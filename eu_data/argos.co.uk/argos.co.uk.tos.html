As user of this website (referred to as \"you/your\") you acknowledge that any use of this website including any transactions you make (\"use/using\") is subject to our terms and conditions below (which includes any other important hyper\\-linked sections e.g. Home delivery information, How to use this website, Returns and refunds, and Privacy policy. In addition, you will find other useful information within Customer services.\n\n\nPlease:\n\n\n* Read through these terms and conditions carefully before using this website.\n* Print a copy for future reference.\n* Also read our Privacy policy section regarding your personal information.\n* Note this website is intended for customers aged 18+. It is not directed at children. Subject to these terms and conditions you are authorised to view and download our website for your personal use only. Argos may change, suspend or discontinue the website at any time, including the availability of any feature, database or content. Argos may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict your access to parts or all of this website without notice or liability.\n\n\n\\*\\*1.General\\*\\*\n\n\n1.1 We reserve the right to change these terms and conditions at any time. Any such changes will take effect when posted on the website (see date at the top) and it is your responsibility to read the terms and conditions on each occasion you use this website and your continued use of the website shall signify your acceptance to be bound by the latest terms and conditions.\n\n\n1.2 If you are not a consumer, you confirm that you have authority to bind any business on whose behalf you use this website.\n\n\n1.3 When you use certain Argos services (including without limitation Gift list service) please read the additional information provided in connection with such services as this information will provide you with full details on how to use those services.\n\n\n1.4 Certain website services will require registration and subsequent access to those services will be subject to an approved login name and password (\"Password Details\"). Information that you provide on this website when registering and/or placing orders must be accurate and complete. Passwords Details are accepted and may be withdrawn at our sole discretion and are exclusive to you and non\\-transferable and must be treated as strictly confidential at all times. In the event you have any concerns regarding your Password Details or become aware of any misuse then you must inform us immediately (see Contact Us for more information and full contact details).\n\n\n1.5 You must not use our website: a) to access information which you have no legitimate reason for accessing; b) in a way which may interfere with the provision of our website to you or any other customer, including, without limitation, attempting to place orders in contravention of these terms and conditions or the law; c) If we reasonably believe you have misused our website, we may suspend or cancel your access to it and/or cancel any orders you have placed;\n\n\n1.6 Access to our website may temporarily be restricted for repairs, standard maintenance or the introduction of new services.\n\n\n1.7 We may change the website in any way or delete features at any time and for any reason.\n\n\n1.8 We reserve the right to decline a new customer registration or order, including multiple registrations or orders, or suspend or terminate a customer's account, order, or access to all or any part of the website at any time, at our sole discretion and without notice.\n\n\n1.9 Certain video games and DVDs are the subject of a legally prescribed age restriction, determined by the British Board of Film Classification. The classifications are 12, 15, and 18. The classification reflects the content of the video game or DVD (violence, language, sex, drug abuse etc). You are therefore required to confirm that you are over 18. We carry out further checks to verify your age with a registered credit reference agency and, if we are unable to verify you are over 18, we will cancel your order.\n\n\n\\*\\*2.Order process\\*\\*\n\n\n2.1 Please see the Home delivery information and How to use this website section for information on how to place an order. All orders that you place on this website will be subject to acceptance in accordance with these terms and conditions.\n\n\n2.2 The 'confirmation' stage sets out the final details of your order. Following this, we will send to you an order acknowledgement email detailing the products you have ordered. Please note that this email is not an order confirmation or order acceptance from Argos. For FastTrack and Tu clothing orders the email/SMS is an acknowledgement of your order, and does not constitute acceptance.\n\n\n2.3 Acceptance of your order and the completion of the contract between you and us will take place on despatch to you of the products ordered unless your order is placed in breach of these terms and conditions and/or we have notified you that we do not accept your order or you have cancelled it (please refer to Returns and refunds). For FastTrack and Tu clothing orders, completion of the contract between you and us will take place when the products ordered have been collected from the store.\n\n\n2.4 We may impose restrictions on the number of single product lines that may be ordered or fulfilled. Orders are subject to availability and at the discretion of the store. Quantities of goods supplied per order and/or per customer, including those goods on price promotion, may be limited if the order limits availability for other customers, takes in our reasonable opinion, unfair use of our offers, or creates a potential health and safety issue during delivery.\n\n\n2.5 We do not file details of your order for you to subsequently access direct on this website, and therefore, please print out these terms and conditions and the order acknowledgement for your own records. If you wish to obtain specific details of your previous orders please contact us.\n\n\n\\*\\*3.Delivery\\*\\*\n\n\n3.1 This website is only for delivery of products to customers in mainland UK and Northern Ireland addresses and for smaller items we can now deliver to the Scottish Islands, Isle of Scilly Isle of Man. Where goods are delivered directly by our suppliers delivery restrictions may apply to Northern Ireland and Scottish Highlands. We cannot deliver to BFPO addresses, or the Republic of Ireland. All goods must be signed for by an adult aged 18 years or over on delivery.\n\n\n3.2 Delivery charges and estimated timescales are specified in the Home delivery information section and also when you place an order. We make every effort to deliver goods within the estimated timescales, however delays are occasionally inevitable due to unforeseen factors. Argos shall be under no liability for any delay or failure to deliver the products within estimated timescales.\n\n\n3.3 Risk of loss or damage of products passes to you on the date when the products are delivered to you or are left with a person or at a place nominated by you. For the purposes of proof of delivery only, where you accept delivery personally our delivery driver may ask either for your signature or may take a photograph of the products at a distance with your door open, which may include images of you. Where you are not present to accept delivery of the products (larger and higher priced items excluded as someone must be at home to accept delivery) , our delivery driver will take a photograph of the place where the products were left. All photographs will be stored in accordance with data protection legislation.\n\n\n3.4 Goods will not be supplied for the purposes of re\\-sale, and are only supplied for your own use as a consumer. We reserve the right to refuse orders including those we consider are for commercial or non\\-domestic purpose. We will not supply or deliver to shipping agents or to agents who sell our goods to third parties.\n\n\n3.5 Where goods are purchased by EU nationals or residents under Geoblocking Regulations, we make no warranty that the goods are suitable for use outside the UK. The goods are provided as compliant with technical, safety, labelling and other legal requirements in the place where they are sold. Where goods are subsequently exported by an EU national or resident, we accept no responsibility for damage in transit, or for any customs requirements or duty.\n\n\n\\*\\*4.Payment\\*\\*\n\n\n4.1 We take payment from your card or PayPal account at the time we receive your order, once we have checked your card or PayPal details and stock availability. Goods are subject to availability. In the event that we are unable to supply the goods, where we have made a mistake, or we have processed your order in breach of these terms and conditions, we will inform you of this as soon as possible. A full refund will be given where you have already paid for the goods. Additional Terms and Conditions for payments made by Paypal can be found at www.paypal.co.uk (this link will open in a new window). (Argos.co.uk is not responsible for the content of external websites.) Please note, the Argos Collection Code, cannot be used to pay for FastTrack orders.\n\n\n4.2 To ensure that your credit, debit, charge card or PayPal account is not being used without your consent, we will validate name, address and other personal information supplied by you during the order process against appropriate third party databases. By accepting these terms and conditions you consent to such checks being made. In performing these checks personal information provided by you may be disclosed to a registered Credit Reference Agency which may keep a record of that information. You can rest assured that this is done only to confirm your identity, that a credit check is not performed and that your credit rating will be unaffected. All information provided by you will be treated securely and strictly in accordance with relevant data protection laws.\n\n\n4.3 a) Online price errors. If we discover an error in the price of goods ordered or reserved, we will inform you as soon as possible (e.g. prior to the goods being dispatched or in store prior to or at the time of the collection of the goods). We will provide you the option of reconfirming your order at the correct price or cancelling it. If we are unable to contact you we will treat the order as cancelled. If you choose to cancel and have already paid for the goods you will receive a full refund.  \nb) If you have purchased using an Argos Monthly Payment Plan, you will need to return the item for a refund and purchase the item again at the lower price, either online by reapplying for the Argos Monthly Payment Plan or instore via an alternative payment method For FastTrack, Tu clothing orders, or other orders where payment is made at the time of ordering for in store collection, the price you pay is the price specified at the point of placing the order and not the prevailing price in store at the time of collection. If on collection the item has come down in price since the order was placed, we will be happy to refund the purchase price and re\\-sell the item at the lower price. If the price has gone up from when the order was placed, the price paid remains valid unless there has been a price error (see 4.3 (a))\n\n\n4.3.1 If, in our opinion, any person or persons, whether acting on behalf of themselves or a business, engages in practices that call into question the fair use of the check and reserve and/or click and collect systems, we reserve the right to cancel reservations or orders and / or to restrict / block access to the check and reserve and/or click and collect systems for that person or persons. Examples of such activity may include placing significant numbers of reservations where the goods are not subsequently collected, placing significant numbers of reservations for the same product without them being subsequently collected and the selling of reservation confirmations. This list is not exhaustive.\n\n\n4.4 Payment can be made by any method specified in How to use this website. For information about secure online ordering see Security.\n\n\n4.5 Title to any products you order on this website shall pass to you on delivery of the products provided that you have placed your order in accordance with these terms and conditions, we have processed your order, and received payment in full for the products. For click and collect orders, the title to products shall pass to you once the goods, ordered in accordance with these terms and conditions, have been handed over to you in store.\n\n\n4.6 All prices are shown in £s sterling and include VAT (where applicable) at the applicable current rates but exclude delivery charges, unless expressly stated otherwise (see Home delivery information for further details including Express delivery charges).\n\n\n4.7 The price of products can be changed more than once.

The classifications are 12, 15, and 18. The classification reflects the content of the video game or DVD (violence, language, sex, drug abuse etc).

<p class="mb-4">2.2 The 'confirmation' stage sets out the final details of your order. Following this, we will send to you an order acknowledgement email detailing the products you have ordered. Please note that this email is not an order confirmation or order acceptance from Argos. For FastTrack and Tu clothing orders the email/SMS is an acknowledgement of your order, and does not constitute acceptance.</p>
<p class="mb-4">2.3 Acceptance of your order and the completion of the contract between you and us will take place on despatch to you of the products ordered unless your order is placed in breach of these terms and conditions and/or we have notified you that we do not accept your order or you have cancelled it (please refer to Returns and refunds). For FastTrack and Tu clothing orders, completion of the contract between you and us will take place when the products ordered have been collected from the store.</p>

Quantities of goods supplied per order and/or per customer, including those goods on price promotion, may be limited if the order limits availability for other customers, takes in our reasonable opinion, unfair use of our offers, or creates a potential health and safety issue during delivery.</p>
<p class="mb-4">2.5 We do not file details of your order for you to subsequently access direct on this website, and therefore, please print out these terms and conditions and the order acknowledgement for your own records.

If on collection the item has come down in price since the order was placed, we will be happy to refund the purchase price and re-sell the item at the lower price. If the price has gone up from when the order was placed, the price paid remains valid unless there has been a price error (see 4.3 (a))</p>
<p class="mb-4">4.3.1 If, in our opinion, any person or persons, whether acting on behalf of themselves or a business, engages in practices that call into question the fair use of the check and reserve and/or click and collect systems, we reserve the right to cancel reservations or orders and / or to restrict / block access to the check and reserve and/or click and collect systems for that person or persons. Examples of such activity may include placing significant numbers of reservations where the goods are not subsequently collected, placing significant numbers of reservations for the same product without them being subsequently collected and the selling of reservation confirmations. This list is not exhaustive.</p>
