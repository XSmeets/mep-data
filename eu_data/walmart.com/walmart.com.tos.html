Placing an Order</h2><h3 data-mce-style="color: #003366;">A. Order Acceptance and Billing</h3><p>You represent and warrant that you have the right to use any credit card or other means of payment that you provide to us. By providing payment card information to us, you authorize us to store and use the card as a payment method for purchases made through your Walmart.com account, including on Walmart affiliated sites and properties which you access via your Walmart.com account credentials. Walmart participates in account update services offered by some banks. If your bank participates in account updater services, these services will automatically update your card number or expiration date in our system when it changes. If you do not want to have your cards automatically updated, you can opt out of these services by contacting your issuing bank. All billing information you provide to us must be truthful and accurate. Providing any untruthful or inaccurate information is a breach of these Terms of Use and may result in cancellation of your order. Prior to accepting an order we may also request additional information from you. Verification of information may be required prior to the acknowledgment or completion of any purchase. We reserve the right to refuse or cancel an order for any reason including limitations on quantities available for purchase, inaccuracies, or errors in product or pricing information, or problems identified by our credit and fraud avoidance department. If your order is canceled after your credit card (or other payment account) has been charged, we will issue a credit to your credit card (or other applicable payment account) in the amount of the charge. We will attempt to contact you if all or any portion of your order is canceled or if additional information is required to accept your order. Walmart may request a pre-authorization for some orders placed online with a credit or debit card. This pre-authorization will not be billed to you; however, your card issuer may hold this amount for a short period. Your card issuer determines the length of time the pre-authorization is held. We do this to ensure that the card details are still valid and that you have sufficient funds to complete the transaction.</p><p>By confirming your purchase at the end of the checkout process, you agree to accept and pay for the Products, as well as all shipping and handling charges and applicable taxes and fees. You will not be charged for most orders until the order has shipped. Some exceptions (when you will be charged at the time your order is placed) are: (i) orders or preorders paid for with a Gift Card, eGift Card, or PayPal account; and (ii) orders paid using the in-store “Cash” payment method.</p><p>Walmart reserves the right, including without prior notice, to limit the quantity of items purchased per person, per household, or per order for any reason. We will attempt to notify you should such limits be applied. Walmart also reserves the right, at our sole discretion, to prohibit sales to dealers or resellers. For purposes of these Terms of Use, “reselling” will be defined as purchasing or intending to purchase any Product(s) from Walmart for the purpose of engaging in a commercial sale of the same Product(s) to a third party.</p><p>In addition to any other remedies available to it, Walmart may in its sole discretion restrict or terminate your account, or cancel or refuse orders for violations of, or abuse of the Walmart returns policy.</p><h3 data-mce-style="color: #003366;">B. Pricing Information; Availability</h3><p>Walmart cannot confirm the price or availability of an item until after your order is placed. Pricing or availability errors may occur on the Walmart Sites or through Marketplace Retailers. The receipt of an order confirmation does not constitute our acceptance of an order or our confirmation of an offer to sell a Product. Walmart reserves the right to cancel any orders containing pricing or availability errors, with no further obligations to you, even after your receipt of an order confirmation or shipping notice from Walmart. Walmart may, at its discretion, either contact you for instructions or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation. Pricing for products may be different on the Walmart Sites or from prices available in Walmart stores or on Walmart Apps.</p><h3 data-mce-style="color: #003366;">C. Promotional Codes</h3><p>Promotional codes are limited in nature and may expire or be discontinued with or without notice. Promotional codes are void where prohibited by law. Promotional codes may not be copied, sold, or otherwise transferred. They are not redeemable for cash and are subject to cancellation or change at any time for any reason without notice. We reserve the right in our discretion to impose conditions on the offering of any promotional code.</p><h3 data-mce-style="color: #003366;">D. Gift Cards</h3><p>The risk of loss and title to any gift cards passes to the purchaser upon our electronic transmission to the recipient or delivery to the carrier, whichever is applicable. Your purchase and use of gift cards is subject to the full terms and conditions related to gift cards, available at <a class="blue" data-mce-style="text-decoration: underline;" data-mce-href="https://www.walmart.com/help/article/Gift-Card-Terms-and-Conditions/9881a4e10ab24dbe8f406df5c75acefd" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.walmart.com/help/article/Gift-Card-Terms-and-Conditions/9881a4e10ab24dbe8f406df5c75acefd">https://walmart.com/help/article/Gift-Card-Terms-and-Conditions/9881a4e10ab24dbe8f406df5c75acefd</a>.</p><h3><span data-mce-style="color: #003366;"><strong>E. Tax Exempt Purchases</strong></span></h3><p>To obtain tax-exempt purchasing privileges for purchases on Walmart.com, you must follow the tax-exempt registration procedure as described on the Site. As part of this process, you may be required to provide additional information to Walmart to confirm your tax-exempt status (for example, a valid state tax-exempt number). You represent and warrant that any information you provide to Walmart as part of the tax-exempt registration process is valid, accurate, and complete. You will promptly notify Walmart of any updates or changes to your tax-exempt status and will promptly provide Walmart with any updated information or documentation. If you purchase any products or services for a tax-exempt purpose and use those products or services for any other purpose, you will report and pay all taxes required under applicable law. If you are a tax-exempt organization, all tax-exempt purchases must be used exclusively by your organization for tax-exempt purposes only. You will comply with all other applicable requirements for tax-exempt purchases under applicable law. You will hold Walmart harmless from and will indemnify Walmart against any claim, loss or expense occurring from any failure to comply with your resale permits or any other tax-exempt requirements, and your exemption will be subject to immediate cancellation.</p><p>You further agree that if you do not use the products or services purchased with your tax-exempt account for the purpose for which your tax exemption applies, you will report and pay sales and use taxes directly to the state relating to the products or services to the extent required by law. In order to qualify for exemption, you may be required by law to pay us using your organization’s payment method (e.g., a company credit card) and not a personal payment method (e.g., a personal credit card). To the extent you have a Business Account, you acknowledge that if you, or any business user accounts associated with your Business Account, make tax exempt purchases with a tax exemption certificate associated with the Business Account, that those purchases are made with the tax-exempt organization’s funds. You will comply with such requirement to the extent required by law.</p><h2 data-mce-style="color: #003366;">9. Shipping and Delivery</h2><p>Products will be shipped to an address designated by you, if applicable, so long as such address is complete and complies with the shipping restrictions contained on the Walmart Sites.

Products purchased from a Marketplace Retailer can only be returned to that Marketplace Retailer in accordance with its return policy. Each Marketplace Retailer’s shipping information, return policy, customer service information, and Marketplace Privacy Policy can be found on that Marketplace Retailer’s Seller Information page.

The arbitrator(s) assigned to the appeal shall be selected by agreement of the parties from among those on the AAA Appellate Panel. If the parties are unable to agree, AAA shall appoint the arbitrator(s) from among those on the AAA Appellate Panel. An arbitrator who previously presided over any aspect of a case shall be ineligible from serving as an appellate arbitrator in that same case.

If any provision of Section 20 other than the Class Action and Mass Action Waiver is held invalid or unenforceable as to a particular dispute or claim, then such provision shall be severed from the Terms of Use, and the remainder of the Terms of Use shall be enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p><ol start="8"><li data-mce-style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;"><strong>Applicable Law.</strong></li></ol><p>The Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of Section 20 of these Terms of Use.
