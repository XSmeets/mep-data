    <h2>Usage terms</h2>

    <p>
        The NHS 111 website is designed and intended for use:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            only by people who live in England; and
        </li>
        <li>
            by individuals in accordance with the embedded instructions for their own
            personal and domestic use without any additional support. The use of this
            website other than for domestic or private use (for any use other than by
            the patient, or their carer) is outside of the clinical safety case that
            governs its use.  Examples of this would be, but not excluded to, use by a
            third party call handler or use within a care setting.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        References to ‘the NHS’ mean ‘the NHS in England’ unless otherwise stated.
        Service descriptions, entitlements and costs refer to services in England and
        arrangements may differ elsewhere in the UK.

        or endorsement on our part. We reserve the right to withdraw linking permission
        without notice.

        computer or database connected to this website. You must not attack this
