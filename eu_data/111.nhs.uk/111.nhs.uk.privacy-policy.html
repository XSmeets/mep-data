    <h1>Privacy statement</h1>

    <p>
        This privacy policy tells you what information we collect when you use
        the NHS 111 online service. It also tells you:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>how we use your information</li>
        <li>who we share your information with</li>
        <li>how we keep your data secure</li>
        <li>about your rights to see or change information held about you</li>
    </ul>

    <hr class="app-section-break nhsuk-u-margin-top-6 nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-6">

    <h2>Information that can identify you</h2>

    <p>We’ll always tell you when we are collecting this information.</p>
    <p>When you use the service we collect:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>your postcode - to get you help in the right location</li>
        <li>your age and sex - so we ask the right medical questions</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        When you answer questions about your symptoms (called ‘triage’) we collect
        the answers. We also collect the symptom you tell us about and the outcome
        (called ‘disposition’) you reach. This is so we can recommend the right
        outcome for your health needs.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you would like to be referred to a healthcare provider after the triage
        we will ask for your:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>first name</li>
        <li>last name</li>
        <li>address and postcode</li>
        <li>telephone number</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        If you’re using the service on behalf of someone else we’ll ask for their
        details. We need this personal information as we can’t give you the
        healthcare service you have asked for without it.
    </p>

    <p>
        We use the personal information you’ve given us to carry out a 'personal demographic service (PDS)' check. This means we try and find your NHS number and your GP details. Having your NHS number means the healthcare professional you’re referred to can see information about you, such as details about any care plan you might be on. This makes it easier for them to give you the right help.
    </p>

    <p>
        We will pass this personal information and the advice you've been given to a healthcare professional. The healthcare professional may
        work outside the NHS (for example, a pharmacist, or dentist), but will have been commissioned by the NHS to provide services for 111.
        By agreeing to be referred to a healthcare professional you consent to the sharing of your personal information in a way which respects
        the Common Law Duty of Confidentiality. We’ll also store the information securely for 8 years for clinical audit purposes only.
    </p>
    <p>
        We collect details from your 111 online visit and link it to data from the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) database. We collect
        your age, sex, date and time of your 111 online visit, the first part of your postcode, the answers to questions we asked
        and your NHS number (if it’s been used).
    </p>
    <p>
        The data will be linked to any recent A&amp;E visit or hospital admission at NHS hospitals in England. After the data is linked and
        before it’s used for analysis, the data will be fully anonymised so that you cannot be identified.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you’re advised to go to another service, we may send your details on to that service. We send your personal information,
        including your NHS number, and the answers to the questions you gave when using 111 online.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you choose to get an email or text message confirming that your details have been sent to the receiving service,
        we use a secure government service called GOV.UK Notify. You can read about how your data is kept secure in the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/privacy" data-event-trigger="click" data-event-value="https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/privacy">GOV.UK Notify privacy notice.<span class="nhsuk-u-visually-hidden"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>
    </p>
    <p>
        We might ask you to complete a survey when you’ve finished using the
        service. The survey is run by 111 online using a tool provided
        by a third party (Qualtrics). The survey will include some information about how you used 111 online
        and what outcome you got. With your permission only, we may link your
        survey responses to the information you entered in the website. This
        information helps us improve the service for future users.
    </p>
    <p>
        We might also ask for your email so we can send you a survey later to ask
        you about what happened after you used 111 online.
    </p>


    <hr class="app-section-break nhsuk-u-margin-top-6 nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-6">

    <h2>Using 111 online in the NHS App</h2>


    <p>
        You can access 111 online on the NHS App using your NHS login details.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you are signed in to the NHS App using NHS login, we will ask your permission to share your NHS login information with our service. This allows us to fill in some personal details for you, such as your name and date of birth.
    </p>

    <p>
        We will not use your NHS login information for any other purposes. You can only share your NHS login information if you have proved your identity to NHS login.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can choose not to share your NHS login information with 111 online, but you will need to enter your information yourself whilst using our service.

    <h2>Other information we may collect</h2>

    <p>
        You can leave feedback on most pages of the website. Feedback on pages is
        collected anonymously. We don’t look at it all the time and are unable to
        give you a response. If you need someone to get back to you please call 111.
    </p>
    <p>
        We also collect anonymous information about how you reached the website,
        for example details of your web browser and part of your IP address. This is so
        we can improve the service for future users.
    </p>

    <hr class="app-section-break nhsuk-u-margin-top-6 nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-6">

    <h2>Keeping your personal data secure</h2>

    <p>
        We convert your data into secure code (encrypt it) and store it on secure
        servers in England. A partner organisation is providing hosting services
        but has no say in how the information is used. There are no legal ways for
        their employees to see the data, only approved people in the NHS 111 online
        development team can see it.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you choose to be referred to a healthcare service, we add your personal
        details to the answers you have given to create a clinical record. We send
        this securely to the healthcare service that you select, which might be a
        service commissioned by the NHS like a pharmacy or dentist. By agreeing to
        be referred to a healthcare professional you agree to this.
    </p>
    <p>
        NHS England keeps referral information that can identify you for 8 years for clinical audit purposes only. It’s then securely destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
        8 years is the amount of time information is kept for clinical audit purposes in the NHS.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you shared your email with us as part of your survey answers it will be deleted after 2 years. At that point you can't be identified in the survey data.
    </p>

    <h3>Links to other websites</h3>

    <p>
        This privacy policy only applies to this website and doesn't cover other
        websites that we link to. If you go to another website from this one, read
        the privacy policy on that website to find out what it does with your
        information.
    </p>


    <hr class="app-section-break nhsuk-u-margin-top-6 nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-6">

    <h2>Data sharing</h2>

    <h3>Providing care</h3>

    <p>
        We will pass your answers and personal details to the healthcare service
        you have selected if you (or the person you are contacting us about),
        choose to be referred. This healthcare service might be outside the NHS,
        but commissioned by it.
    </p>
    <p>
        That healthcare service may then go on to share your data with other
        healthcare providers. They will follow their own policies and data protection legislation if so.
    </p>
    <p>
        By agreeing to be referred to another healthcare provider you are also
        agreeing that your data can be forwarded to them so they can provide
        care. If you’re contacting us on behalf of someone else you should make
        sure that person has agreed their data can be shared in this way.
    </p>

    <h3>Other uses of your data</h3>

    <p>NHS England will also share:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            anonymous information on how the service is used with the Department of

        </li>
        <li>
            anonymous information to improve the service with 111 online suppliers,

            National Clinical Advisory Group
        </li>
        <li>
            results from user research and changes made to the service as a result of
            it with ICBs

    <p>
        The Department of Health and Social Care has instructed NHS England to
