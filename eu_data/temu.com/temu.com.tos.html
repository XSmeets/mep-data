At the same time, our liability for such other damages is limited to those damages that are deemed typical for this type of contract and foreseeable. We are not liable for any unforeseeable losses. Unforeseeable losses are losses that are unexpected, and it was not obvious that they would arise, and there was nothing you said to us before entering this Agreement that meant that we should have expected them to arise. Possible liabilities according to product liability law remain unaffected. Any further liability is excluded.</p><p>(3) We do not warrant or assume liability for obligations according to facilitated contracts with any third parties.</p><p>(4) Furthermore, we shall not be liable for the accuracy, reliability, or completeness of the Content provided by us on Temu free of charge or any damages that may arise from such Content.</p><p></p></ul><h2>15.

Your use of the App Store Sourced Application must comply with the App Store Terms of Service.</p><p>(2) You acknowledge that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the App Store Sourced Application.</p><p>(3) In the event of any failure of the App Store Sourced Application to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price for the App Store Sourced Application to you and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the App Store Sourced Application. As between Apple and us, any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be our sole responsibility.</p><p>(4) You and we acknowledge that, as between Apple and us, Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims you have or any claims of any third party relating to the App Store Sourced Application or your possession and use of the App Store Sourced Application, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the App Store Sourced Application fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.</p><p>(5) You and we acknowledge that, in the event of any third-party claim that the App Store Sourced Application or your possession and use of that App Store Sourced Application infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, as between Apple and us, we, not Apple, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defence, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim to the extent required by the Terms.</p><p>(6) You and we acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of the Terms as related to your license of the App Store Sourced Application, and that, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of the Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce the Terms as related to your license of the App Store Sourced Application against you as a third-party beneficiary.</p><p>(7) Without limiting any other terms of the Terms, you must comply with all applicable third-party terms of agreement when using the App Store Sourced Application.</p></ul><h2>17.
