<h1>
  <strong>TERMS OF SERVICE</strong>
</h1>

<h3>38 Degrees is independent of all political parties, and we are working towards the following vision:</h3>
<h3>A fairer country</h3>
<p>A country where everyone gets a fair chance in life. Where the place we were born, or the area we live in, doesn’t decide that chance. Where it’s not ‘one rule for them’, and another for the rest of us.</p> 
<h3>A more respectful country</h3>
<p>A country where we're respectful of each other. Where we focus on what we have in common with one another, rather than what divides us. And where we are not afraid to have discussions or disagree, because we treat one another with kindness.</p>
<h3>A more sustainable world</h3>
<p>A place where we all take personal responsibility in what we do big and small to protect our environment, and we hold big companies and our government to account for their role in saving our planet.</p>
<h3>We reserve the right to remove any campaigns or comments that do not share these values.
</h3>

<hr>
<p>
  These Terms of Service outline the terms and conditions upon which you can use our website to create campaigns, sign campaigns and connect with other 38
  Degrees members who live near you.
</p>
<h2>
  1. ACCEPTING OUR TERMS OF SERVICE
</h2>
<p>
  By signing up to join or become an organiser, creating a campaign on our website, joining a 38 Degrees Group (as a member or an organiser) or ticking the
  box next to the words “I agree to the Terms of Service” on our website, you signify that you accept these Terms of Service and agree to be bound by them.
</p>
<h2>
  2. CREATING A CAMPAIGN
</h2>
<p>
  2.1 We reserve the right to remove any petition which we judge to promote illegal acts, hatred, violence, discrimination or stereotypes based on race, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, disability, nationality or religion
</p>
<p>
2.1.1 Campaigns may not explicitly promote political parties.</p>

<ul>
<li>You are welcome to set up a petition if you are a politician or part of a local political party. However we reserve the right to edit or remove a petition if we judge its main purpose is to promote or oppose a political party, or candidate. </li>
<li>Petitions should be set up by individuals and not under a party name, and should focus on policy alone. </li>
<li>Campaigns should be relevant to everyone, whether or not they are members or supporters of a particular political party, which means 38 Degrees is not the place to settle political party in-fighting.</li>
<li>Please inform the 38 Degrees team if you are an elected official or candidate so that we can mark your petition appropriately.</li>
</ul>

<p>
2.1.2 We reserve the right to edit or remove petitions targeting individuals when we believe they:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infringe upon their human rights or employment rights</li>
 <ul>
 <li>For example by calling for an employee in a non-elected job to be sacked</li>
 </ul>
<li>Infringe on their right to a fair trial</li>
<li>Are quite simply nasty</li></ul>


<p>
2.1.3 We reserve the right to remove any petition which opposes 38 Degrees, or opposes one of the campaigns that 38 Degrees is running as an organisation.
</p>

<p>
  2.1.4 The wording and claims in your petition must be factual and true. We reserve the right to remove or force you to edit any petition that makes claims that are not backed up by impartial 3rd party evidence. Likewise petitions must focus on the actions that people have taken rather than conjecture about people's motivations.
</p>

<p>
2.2 If you would like to create a campaign using our website, you must set up an account with us. When setting up your account, you must provide information about yourself that is true, current and complete. The name you use to set up your account will be shown on your petition page under the heading 'Campaign created by', and will be viewable by anyone who signs or views the petition online. 
</p>
<p>
  2.3 You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your account. You are also solely responsible for all activities
  conducted through your account.
</p>
<p>
  2.4 You must notify us immediately of any unauthorised use of your account. We will not be liable for any loss or damage arising in connection with any
  unauthorised use of your account.
</p>
<p>
  2.5 When you provide us with your email address and, at your option, your mobile phone number at any time, including when you join a Group, you consent to receiving messages (including by email, SMS and/or MMS):
</p>
<ul>
  (a) from the individuals and organisations who have signed your campaign;<br>
  (b) from us in relation to your campaign<br>
</ul>

<p>
  2.6 You can unsubscribe from messages sent by us and/or our related bodies corporate and trusted partners at any time by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link
  at the bottom of our emails.
</p>
<p>
  2.7 As the creator of a campaign, you will have access to the names and other personal information of the individuals signing your campaign, either for
  him/herself or on behalf of an organisation (“Campaigners’ Details”).
</p>
<p>
  2.8 You may use the Campaigners’ Details for the sole purpose of sharing information directly relating to your campaign (such as sending updates on the number of signatures reached). You can not send more than 3 messages per week to any individual or organisation.
</p>
<p>
i. You may not use Campaigners’ Details for the purpose of promoting yourself as a political candidate, politician, or for promoting any political party.
</p>
<p>
  2.9 You must immediately stop sending messages (including by email, SMS and MMS) to anyone who asks to be unsubscribed from your communications.
</p>
<p>
  2.10 You acknowledge that we have no control over the messages sent to you by the individuals or organisations who sign your campaign.
</p>
<p>
  2.11 You release and forever discharge us from any liability, action, claim, injury, loss or damage you suffer or incur relating to, or in connection with,
  any campaign you create on our website, any messages you receive from other users of our website, and any event you attend that has been organised on our
  website.
</p>
<p>
  2.12 This website aims to influence UK decisions makers. We do not accept petitions that are aimed at foreign governments, institutions or individuals. If you start a petition that seeks to influence a foreign government, institutions or individual, we reserve the right to amendment such petitions, in order to make a UK decision maker the central focus of that petition. In such circumstances, we will identify UK decision makers that may be able to influence relevant foreign governments, institutions or individuals.<br>
<br>
This website only accepts signatures from people with a UK postcode.
</p>
<p>
  2.13 38 Degrees is committed to providing a safe and respectful working environment for all our staff. This means we reserve the right to close your account, your petition, or partnership if you are disrespectful, abusive or threatening to a member of 38 Degrees staff team. This includes, but is not limited to, behaviour such as shouting, nuisance calling, posting on personal social media accounts, making threats, or attempting to bribe, guilt or coerce our staff team into putting your campaign ahead of 38 Degrees members priorities.
</p>

</ul>
<p>
  3.5 You release and forever discharge us from any liability, action, claim, injury, loss or damage you suffer or incur relating to, or in connection with
  your involvement in any campaign you sign on our website (including any messages you receive from the creator of a campaign), any messages you receive from
  other users of our website, and any event you attend that has been organised on our website.
</p>
<h2>
  4. YOUR CONTENT
</h2>
<p>
  4.1 You warrant that all text, images and other content you post on our website, including on any Group site (Your Content) is your original work and/or to
  the extent that Your Content includes any text, images or other content owned by a third party, you warrant that you are licensed to use and reproduce such
  content on our website.
</p>
<p>
  4.2 You understand and agree that we may, in our sole discretion and without notice, edit and/or remove any campaign you have created on our website or any
  of Your Content which we believe violates these Terms of Service or which is or may be offensive, illegal, defamatory, or infringe the rights, or threaten
  the safety, of others.
</p>
<p>
  4.3 By submitting and posting Your Content on our website, you give 38 Degrees and our related bodies corporate a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide,

  any medium, for the purpose of promoting your campaign.
</p>
<p>
  4.4 We reserve the right to remove any user contribution or event for any reason. This is a decision we will strive to make fairly, but ultimately is a
  decision that is solely up to us to take.
</p>
<h2>
  5. USING OUR WEBSITE
</h2>
<p>
  5.1 Our website is available for your personal and non-commercial use only.
</p>
<p>
  5.2 38 Degrees does not endorse or authorise any campaigns or member generated content on our website.
</p>
<p>
  5.3 You must use our website in accordance with these Terms of Service only for lawful purposes and in a way which does not infringe the rights of anyone
  or restrict or inhibit anyone’s use of our website.
</p>
<p>
  5.4 You must not harvest or collect email addresses, mobile phone numbers or other personal information about other users of our website for the purpose of
  sending unsolicited commercial messages or for any other purpose.
</p>
<p>
  5.5 We update and carry out maintenance on our website regularly, so we may have to suspend access, service or functionality on our website from time to
  time, without notice. We will not be liable if, for any reason, our website is not available at any time or for any period of time.
</p>
<p>
  5.7 We own, or are the licensee of, the intellectual property rights in the content of our website, including text, photos, images and trademarks.
</p>
<p>
5.8 By using this website you confirm that you are over 16 years of age. <br>
We do not knowingly process data of any person under the age of 16. If we come to discover, or have reason to believe, that you are 15 and under and we are holding your personal information, we will delete that information within a reasonable period and withhold our services accordingly.</p>
<p>
5.9<b> Personal information is processed on the basis of an individual’s vital interests</b>. Applicable law allows us to process personal information in emergency (i.e. life or death) situations. For example, where the contents of a petition / campaign started or signed may lead us to make a reasonable conclusion that there is a risk of suicide or self-harm, we will report this to the relevant authorities

  this term.

</p>

  7.4.2 your immediate, temporary or permanent expulsion from any 38 Degrees Group of which you are a member;<br>
