	<h2 id="_s1">Privacy Notice</h2>
	<p>The Government of Canada and the CBSA are committed to providing websites that respect the privacy of visitors. This privacy notice summarizes the privacy  practices for the CBSA's online activities.</p>
	<p>All personal information collected by this institution is governed by the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-21/index.html"><cite>Privacy Act</cite></a>.  This means that you will be informed of the purpose for which your personal information is being collected and how to exercise your right of access to that information.</p>
	
	<section>
		<h3 id="_s1a">Your privacy and the internet</h3>
		<p>The nature of the Internet is such that web servers automatically collect certain information about a visit to a website, including the visitor's Internet Protocol (<abbr>IP</abbr>) address. <abbr>IP</abbr> addresses are unique numbers assigned by Internet Service Providers (<abbr>ISP</abbr>) to all devices used to access the Internet. web servers automatically log the <abbr>IP</abbr> addresses of visitors to their sites. The <abbr>IP</abbr> address, on its own, does not identify an individual. However, in certain circumstances, such as with the <span class="nowrap">co-operation</span> of an <abbr>ISP</abbr> for example, it could be used to identify an individual using the site. For this reason, the Government of Canada considers the <abbr>IP</abbr> address to be personal information, particularly when combined with other data automatically collected when a visitor requests a web page such as the page or pages visited, date and time of the visit.</p>
		<p>Unless otherwise noted, the CBSA does not automatically gather any specific information from you, such as your name, telephone number or email address. The CBSA would obtain this type of information only if you supply it to us, for example, by email or by filling in a contact form. In such cases, details about how your personal information is handled will be provided in a Personal Information Collection Statement.</p>
		<p>In cases where services are provided by organizations  outside of the Government of Canada, such as social media platforms or mobile applications, <abbr>IP</abbr> addresses may be recorded by the web server of the <span class="nowrap">third-party</span> service provider.</p>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<h3 id="_s1b">Communicating with the Government of Canada</h3>
		<p>If you choose to send the CBSA an email or complete a feedback form online, the CBSA uses your personal information to respond to your inquiry. The information you provide will only be shared with another government institution if your inquiry relates to that institution. The CBSA does not use the information to create individual profiles nor does it disclose the information to anyone other than those in the federal government who need to provide you with a response. Any disclosure of your personal information is in accordance with the <cite>Privacy&nbsp;Act</cite>.</p>
		<p>Emails and other electronic methods used to communicate with the Government of Canada are not secure unless it is specifically stated on a web page. Therefore, it is recommended that you <strong>do&nbsp;not</strong> send sensitive  personal information, such as your Social Insurance Number or your date of birth, through <span class="nowrap">non-secure</span> electronic means.</p>
		<p>Personal information from emails or completed feedback forms is collected pursuant to the <cite>Financial Administration Act</cite> and the <cite>Canada Border Services Agency Act</cite>. Such information may be used for statistical, evaluation and reporting purposes and is included in Personal Information Bank <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/access-information-privacy/access-information/information-about-programs-information-holdings/standard-personal-information-banks.html">Public Communications (<abbr>PSU</abbr>&nbsp;914)</a>.</p>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<h3 id="_s1c"><span class="nowrap">Third-party</span> social media</h3>
		<p>The CBSA's use of social media serves as an extension of its presence on the web. Social media account(s) are public and are not hosted on Government of  Canada servers. Users who choose to interact with us via social media should read the terms of service and privacy policies of these <span class="nowrap">third-party</span> service providers and those of any applications you use to access them. The CBSA uses <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/privacy">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/t/privacy_at_youtube?hl=en">YouTube</a>.</p>
		<p>Personal information that you provide to the Government of Canada via social media account(s) is collected under the authority of the <cite>Financial Administration Act</cite> and the <cite>Canada Border Services Agency Act</cite>. This information is collected to capture conversations (e.g. questions and answers, comments, "likes", retweets) between you and the CBSA. It may be used to respond to inquiries, or for statistical,  evaluation and reporting purposes. Comments posted that violate Canadian law  will be deleted and disclosed to law enforcement authorities. Comments that violate our rules of engagement will also be deleted. The personal information is included in Personal Information Bank <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/access-information-privacy/access-information/information-about-programs-information-holdings/standard-personal-information-banks.html">Outreach Activities (<abbr>PSU</abbr>&nbsp;938)</a>.</p>

		<h3 id="_s1d">Improving your experience on Government of Canada websites</h3>
		
		<section>
			<h4 id="_s1d1">Digital markers (including cookies)</h4>
			<p>A digital marker is a resource created by the visitors' browser in order to remember certain pieces of information for the web server to reference during the same or subsequent visit to the website. Examples of digital markers are "cookies" or <abbr>HTML5</abbr> web storage. Some examples of what digital markers do are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>they allow a website to recognize a previous visit each time the visitor accesses the&nbsp;site</li>
			  <li>they track what information is viewed on a site which helps website administrators ensure visitors find what they are looking&nbsp;for</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The CBSA uses sessional and persistent digital markers on some portions of its website. During  your online visit, your browser exchanges data with the CBSA's web server. The digital markers used do not allow the CBSA to identify individuals.</p>
			<p>You may adjust your browser settings to reject digital markers, including cookies, if you so choose. However, it may affect your ability to interact with the CBSA's website.</p>
		</section>
	
		<section>
			<h4 id="_s1d2">Web analytics</h4>
			<p>web analytics is the collection, analysis, measurement, and reporting of data about web traffic and visits for purposes of understanding and optimizing web usage. Information in digital markers may be used for the purpose of web analytics to remember your online interactions with the CBSA's website.</p>
			<p>The CBSA uses AWStats to improve its website. When your computer requests a CBSA web page, our institution collects the following types of information for web analytics:</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>the originating <abbr>IP</abbr> address</li>
			  <li>the date and time of the request</li>
			  <li>the type of browser&nbsp;used</li>
			  <li>the page(s) visited</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The CBSA uses AWStats internally and retains information collected for web analytics for a maximum period of 18&nbsp;months. After this period, the information must be disposed of in accordance with the Standard on Privacy and Web Analytics and as authorized by the Librarian and Archivist of Canada. The information is not disclosed to an external <span class="nowrap">third-party</span> service provider.</p>
			<p>Information used for the purpose of web analytics is collected pursuant to the <cite>Financial Administration Act</cite> and the <cite>Canada Border Services Agency Act</cite>. Such data may be used for communications and information technology statistical purposes, audit, evaluation, research, planning and reporting. For more  information on how your privacy is safeguarded in relation to web analytics, see the Standard on Privacy and Web Analytics.</p>
		</section>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<h3 id="_s1e">Protecting the Security of Government of Canada websites</h3>
		<p>The CBSA employs software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. This software receives and records the <abbr>IP</abbr> address of the computer that has contacted our website, the date and time of the visit and the pages visited. We make no attempt to link these addresses with the identity of individuals visiting our site unless an attempt to damage the site has been detected.</p>
		<p>This information is collected pursuant to the <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/f-11/"><cite>Financial Administration Act</cite></a>. The information may be shared with appropriate law enforcement authorities if suspected criminal activities are detected. Such information may be used for network security statistical purposes, audit, evaluation, research, planning and reporting and is included in Personal Information Bank <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/access-information-privacy/access-information/information-about-programs-information-holdings/standard-personal-information-banks.html">Security Incidents (<abbr>PSU</abbr>&nbsp;939)</a>.</p>

	<section>
		<h3 id="_s1f">Inquiring about these practices</h3>
		<p>Any questions, comments, concerns or complaints you may have regarding the administration of the <cite>Privacy Act</cite> and privacy policies regarding the CBSA's web presence may be directed to our Access to Information and Privacy Coordinator by email to <a href="mailto:atip-aiprp@cbsa-asfc.gc.ca">atip-aiprp@cbsa-asfc.gc.ca</a>, by calling the Access to Information and Privacy Division at <span class="nowrap">613-960-1414</span> or writing to the Access to  Information and Privacy Director&nbsp;at:</p>

	<h2 id="_s2">Using files located on <span class="nowrap">non-Government</span> of Canada servers</h2>
	<p>To improve the functionality of Government of Canada websites, certain files (such as open source libraries, images and scripts) may be delivered automatically to your browser via a trusted <span class="nowrap">third-party</span> server or content delivery network.

When there is no obligation to provide information in both official languages, content may be available in one official language only.

<section>
	<h2 id="_s7">Interacting with us on social media</h2>
	<p>This notice has been written to explain how the CBSA interacts with the public on social media platforms.</p>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<h3 id="_s7a">Content and frequency</h3>
		<p>We use our social media accounts as an alternative method of sharing the content posted on our website and interacting with our stakeholders. By following our social media accounts (by "following," "liking" or "subscribing"), you can expect to see information about the programs and services we provide.</p>
		<p>We understand that the web is a 24/7 medium, and your comments are welcome at any time. You should expect to see new content posted Monday to Friday from 8:00&nbsp;a.m. to 4:00&nbsp;p.m. <abbr>EST</abbr>/<abbr>EDT</abbr>. Comments submitted after hours or on weekends are read and responded to as soon as possible.</p>
		<p>Any communications activity during holidays, after core hours and on weekends would likely be related to an emergency or of an urgent nature, of significant value to our followers and subscribers. Otherwise, the accounts will be relatively inactive during these times.</p>
		<p>Because the servers of social media platforms are managed by a <span class="nowrap">third-party</span>, our social media accounts are subject to downtime that may be  out of our control. As such, we accept no responsibility for platforms becoming unresponsive or unavailable.</p>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<h3 id="_s7b">Links to other websites and ads</h3>
		<p>Our social media accounts may post or display links or ads for websites that are not under our control. These links are provided solely for the convenience of users. The Government of Canada is not responsible for the information found through these links or ads, nor does it endorse the sites or their content.</p>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<h3 id="_s7c">Follow, favourite and subscribe </h3>
		<p>Our decision to "follow", "favourite" or "subscribe" to another social media account does not imply an endorsement of that account, channel, page or site, and neither does sharing (retweeting, liking, reposting or linking to) content from another&nbsp;user.</p>
		<p>At this time, the CBSA's decision to "follow", "favourite" or "subscribe" will be limited to other Government of Canada institutions and organizations determined to be relevant to our followers or subscribers and to the CBSA's mandate.</p>
		<p>We will share (retweet, repost, like or link to) information posted by accounts that are diverse, <span class="nowrap">non-commercial</span>, and <span class="nowrap">non-partisan</span> and of value to our followers and subscribers.</p>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<h3 id="_s7d">Comments and interaction</h3>
		<p>We will read comments and participate in discussions when appropriate. We ask that your comments be relevant and respectful. We reserve the right to delete comments that violate this notice, and the user may be blocked and reported to prevent further inappropriate comments.</p>
		<p>We cannot engage in issues of party politics or answer questions that break the rules of this notice.</p>
		<p>We reserve the right to edit or remove comments&nbsp;that:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>contain personal information</li>
		  <li>are contrary to the principles of the <cite>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</cite></li>
		  <li>express racist, hateful, sexist, homophobic, slanderous, insulting or <span class="nowrap">life-threatening</span> messages</li>
		  <li>put forward serious, unproven or inaccurate accusations against individuals or organizations</li>
		  <li>are aggressive, coarse, violent, obscene or pornographic</li>
		  <li>are offensive, rude or abusive to an individual or an organization</li>
		  <li>are not sent by the author or are put forward for advertising purposes</li>
		  <li>encourage illegal activity</li>
		  <li>contain announcements from labour or political organizations</li>
		  <li>are written in a language other than English or French</li>
		  <li>are unintelligible or irrelevant</li>
		  <li>are repetitive or&nbsp;spam</li>
		  <li>do not, in our opinion, add to the normal flow of the discussion</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In short, please be respectful and make sure that your comments are relevant to where they are posted. The views of users commenting on our social media accounts do not necessarily represent the views of the CBSA or the Government of Canada.</p>
		<p>Also, please note that you participate in social media at your own risk, taking personal responsibility for your comments, your username and any information provided. To protect your own privacy and the privacy of others, please do not include full names, home phone numbers or email addresses, photographs containing images of identifiable individuals, or any other personal information in the body of your comment.</p>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<h3 id="_s7e">Accessibility of social media platforms</h3>
		<p>Social media platforms are <span class="nowrap">third-party</span> service providers and are not bound by Government of Canada standards for web accessibility.</p>
		<p>If you have difficulty accessing content on our social media accounts, please contact us and we will try to solve the problem or provide you with the information in a different format.</p>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<h3 id="_s7f">Copyright</h3>
		<p>Information that we post is subject to the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/index.html"><cite>Copyright&nbsp;Act</cite></a>.</p>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<h3 id="_s7g">Privacy</h3>
		<p>Our social media accounts are not Government of Canada websites and represent only our presence on <span class="nowrap">third-party</span> service providers.</p>
		<p>For more information, please refer to the <a href="#_s1c">CBSA Privacy Notice regarding <span class="nowrap">third-party</span> social media</a>.</p>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<h3 id="_s7h">Official languages</h3>
		<p>Many social media platforms have multiple language options and provide instructions on how to set your preferences. The Government of Canada respects the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/O-3.01/index.html"><cite>Official Languages Act</cite></a> and is committed to ensuring that our information is available in both French and English and that both versions are of equal quality.</p>
		<p>We reply to comments in the official language in which they are posted. If we think the response is a question of general public interest, we may provide the  information in both official languages.</p>
		<p>The CBSA may share links that direct users to sites of organizations or other entities that are not subject to the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/O-3.01/index.html"><cite>Official Languages Act</cite></a> and available only in  the language(s) in which they are written. When content is available in only one language, we make an effort to provide similar content in the other official language.</p>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<h3 id="_s7i">Media requests</h3>
		<p>Reporters are asked to contact our <a href="/media/media-eng.html">media relations&nbsp;team</a>.</p>
