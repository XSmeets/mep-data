<p>We will take all reasonable care, in so far as it is in our power to do so, to keep the details of your order and payment secure, but in the absence of negligence on our part we cannot be held liable for any loss you may suffer if a third party procures unauthorised access to any data you provide when accessing or ordering from the Website.&nbsp;<a href="/customer-services/returns">Find out more about our Refund policy</a>&nbsp;which is incorporated into these Conditions.</p>
<h3>Contract creation and electronic contracting</h3>
<p>The technical steps required to create the contract between you and us are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>You place the order for your products on the Website by pressing the confirm order button at the end of the checkout process. You will be guided through the process of placing an order by a series of simple instructions on the Website</li>
<li>You'll need JavaScript enabled on your computer to buy products and check out. Please enable JavaScript in your browser, then refresh your browser to continue. Alternatively, please call 03456 049 049 to order by phone</li>
<li>We may send you an order acknowledgement email as soon as you place your order, and you will receive an order confirmation email detailing the Products you have ordered. These emails do not constitute acceptance of your order<br>
</li>
<li>For items being delivered to you (as opposed to Click &amp; collect), when your product is shipped from our warehouse we will send you a despatch confirmation email</li>
<li>Order acceptance and the completion of the contract between you and us will take place on the despatch to you of the Products ordered unless we have notified you that we do not accept your order, or you have cancelled it in accordance with the instructions in&nbsp;<a href="/customer-services/orders/how-to-change-or-cancel-your-order">Change or cancel an order</a></li>
<li>For most products sent directly from our warehouse, your credit/debit card will be charged when your order is placed.<br>
</li>
<li>If the product is being delivered direct to you from a supplier, for instance in the case of larger products such as electrical appliances and furniture, you may be charged at any point between confirmation of your order and despatch. The exact timing of this will vary according to supplier and the product you're ordering</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Non-acceptance of an order may be a result of one of the following</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The product you ordered being unavailable from stock</li>
<li>Our inability to obtain authorisation for your payment</li>
<li>The identification of a pricing or product description error</li>
<li>Your not meeting the eligibility to order criteria set out in the main Terms &amp; Conditions</li>
<li>If you are placing an order for an item that by law is age-restricted,&nbsp;then by clicking the order confirm button you are also confirming to us that you are of at least the legal age required to purchase the product. By clicking the order confirm button,&nbsp;you further acknowledge and consent to us taking steps to verify your age by reference&nbsp;to&nbsp;publicly-available third-party sources.&nbsp; We reserve the right not to supply any age-restricted product where we reasonably believe that you are below the relevant minimum age.&nbsp;<br>
</li>
<li>All age-restricted goods must be received by a person who is at least 18 years old at the time of delivery or click &amp; collect handover. We require this regardless of the relevant age limit for the age-restricted product. As an example, age-restricted digital media with an age restriction of 15 can only be given over at the point of delivery or Click &amp; collect handover to an individual who is 18 years old or over.<br>
</li>
<li>We reserve the right to request proof of age identification from you if your order contains age-restricted goods, and we are unsure that you are at least 18 years old at the point of delivery or at the point of Click &amp; collect handover. For the delivery or handover of all age-restricted goods, we operate on a Challenge 25 basis, which means that if we think you look under the age of 25, we will ask you to show us proof of age identification. If you are asked for proof of age identification and are unable to provide us with any, we reserve the right to withhold the delivery or Click &amp; collect the order.<br>
</li>
<li>We&nbsp;reserve&nbsp;the&nbsp;right&nbsp;to&nbsp;limit&nbsp;the&nbsp;number&nbsp;of&nbsp;a&nbsp;given&nbsp;item&nbsp;that&nbsp;can&nbsp;be bought&nbsp;by&nbsp;an&nbsp;individual&nbsp;customer&nbsp;should&nbsp;we&nbsp;deem&nbsp;it&nbsp;appropriate. We&nbsp;also&nbsp;reserve&nbsp;the&nbsp;right&nbsp;to&nbsp;suspend&nbsp;your&nbsp;account and any associated accounts and contact you if&nbsp;we&nbsp;notice&nbsp;an&nbsp;unusual pattern&nbsp;of&nbsp;returns activity or there is other suspicious activity associated with&nbsp;your&nbsp;account or any associated accounts. In&nbsp;the&nbsp;event&nbsp;that&nbsp;this happens you will receive&nbsp;an&nbsp;email not notify&nbsp;you&nbsp;of&nbsp;this<br>
</li>
<li>Should we have taken payment prior to non-acceptance of your Order then we will refund you, but please note that it can take up to 5 days for the bank to transfer the funds to you<br>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The contract will be concluded in English.</p>
<p>The details of your specific contract will not be filed by johnlewis.com. If you do require any information regarding orders you have placed with johnlewis.com, please write to us at:&nbsp;<b>Customer Services, johnlewis.com, Selectapost 57, Sheffield, S97 3GL</b></p>
<h3>Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013</h3>
<p>This legislation offers you the following cancellation rights when you buy online or by phone:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are entitled to cancel your contract if you so wish, provided that you exercise your right no longer than 14 days after the day on which you receive the goods or services.</li>
<li>Your right to&nbsp;return or cancel&nbsp;products does not apply to goods&nbsp;that are&nbsp;made to&nbsp;measure or are made&nbsp;to&nbsp;your specification, that have been clearly personalised or which by reason of their nature cannot be returned or are liable to deteriorate or expire rapidly.&nbsp;This doesn't affect your statutory rights if goods are faulty or not as described.</li>
<li>If you wish to exercise your right of cancellation, you are obliged to retain possession of the goods and take reasonable care of them.</li>
<li>To exercise the right to cancel, you must inform us of your decision to cancel your contract by a clear statement, including details of your name, geographical address, details of the order you wish to cancel and, where available, your phone number and email address.</li>
<li>You can cancel by <a href="/customer-services/email-us">email</a>&nbsp;or call 03456 049 049, or write to: Customer Services, johnlewis.com, Selectapost 57, Sheffield S97 3GL</li>
<li>If you decide to cancel, you should return the goods to us at your cost within 14 days of such cancellation and we will reimburse to you (by the method used to pay for the original transaction) the amount in relation to goods to which cancellation rights apply. This includes the cost of delivery (except for the supplementary costs arising if you choose a type of delivery other than our standard and least expensive method of delivery).<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>We may make a deduction from the reimbursement for loss in value of any goods supplied, if the loss is the result of unnecessary handling by you. We will make the reimbursement no later than 14 days after the day we receive back from you any goods supplied.</li>

<h3>Guarantees for large domestic appliances and consumer electronics products</h3>
<p>We always honour the manufacturer's guarantee period where offered; these are usually one year unless otherwise stated. Please see individual product pages for details.</p>
<p>In addition to the first year manufacturer's guarantee on all electrical and technology products we provide a second year service guarantee at no extra cost, and it's 5 years on all TVs. We also include a 2-year guarantee on all lighting, except Christmas, solar-powered and nursery lighting.</p>
<h3>What does the guarantee cover?</h3>
<p>Our guarantees provide full cover against mechanical breakdown through normal use. This means that if your item develops a fault during the guarantee period, we'll arrange for it to be repaired free of charge, including all parts and labour.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Large domestic appliances include the following ranges of products: washing machines, tumble dryers, washer dryers, dishwashers, fridges, freezers, fridge freezers and cookers (excluding microwaves).</p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>During the guarantee period, if your product develops a fault that needs to be repaired, look for visible signs of the breakdown and consult the fault-finding guide in the manufacturer's handbook, if any.</p>
<p>If that doesn't resolve the issue, please contact your local John Lewis shop and talk to one of our Partners. You'll need to provide us with details of your item, including the model number and date of purchase. You'll find all of this information on our original receipt – this acts as your guarantee, so please make sure you keep it safe.</p>
<p>If we can't repair your item, we'll replace it with an item of equivalent specification (or if you have an electrical lighting product, we may supply spare parts instead). If no equivalent product is available, we'll either offer you the nearest equivalent specification or its selling price value , and we'll always do our best to make sure you're satisfied with the outcome.</p>
<h3>What's not included?</h3>
<p>There are some specific exclusions from our guarantees, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Repair costs caused by external factors such as computer viruses, faulty software, fire, theft, and weather (including lightning damage)</li>
<li>Accidental damage, for example if your item has been dropped. You may find that this type of damage is covered by your household contents insurance policy</li>
<li>Image ghosting or screen burn. These can appear on a screen that's left operating for a prolonged period with either a still image or a channel constantly displaying a logo</li>
<li>Pixel spots. These are tiny dark or bright spots that may become visible on a screen</li>
<li>Digital television picture affected by any of the following: a misaligned or unsuitable aerial, climatic conditions, geographic location, poor quality or low strength broadcast signal</li>
<li>Consumables such as batteries, ink cartridges, storage media, rear projection television bulbs, fuses, light bulbs etc</li>
<li>Battery-operated toys</li>
<li>Nursery, solar-powered and Christmas lighting</li>
<li>If the product has been used commercially or for business purposes (with the exception of computers)</li>

<p>The My John Lewis Review Programme allows selected My John Lewis members to try and review various products in order to assist other My John Lewis members in finding the best products for them. Customers are invited to join the My John Lewis Review Programme based on their shopping preferences and review history. My John Lewis Review members may be invited to try products that are not yet available on the market - this is where their reviews are the most important. We do not modify or edit reviews as we believe in offering completely honest feedback. They will, however, like all reviews, be subject to our standard moderation guidelines. You can find out more about how to write a helpful review <a href="/customer-services/shopping-with-us/ratings-and-reviews">here</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>HOW DO I BECOME A MEMBER?</b></p>
<p>In order to select the people best suited to the programme, we invite My John Lewis members to join based on their shopping histories, review history and participation in our various events and experiences. If you no longer wish to participate simply email <a href="mailto:myjlreviewpanel@johnlewis.co.uk">myjlreviewpanel@johnlewis.co.uk</a> and you will be removed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>I HAVE REGISTERED TO THE MY JOHN LEWIS REVIEW PANEL, WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?</b></p>
<p>After registering to the My John Lewis Review Panel, you'll start receiving invitations from our team to inform you when new products are available for a trial. We ask that you only accept invitations for trials you are able to complete within 2-4 weeks of receiving the initial invitation email. If you’re chosen as a good match for the trial, you’ll receive another email from us within 10 days. If you haven’t heard from us, maybe check your spam folder in case it’s ended up there. We will do our best to keep you up to date on your application status but if you don’t hear back from us, this means you unfortunately haven’t been selected this time. But please keep an eye out for emails about future product trials. Our team works hard to make sure we match items to those best suited to review them, but sometimes we simply don’t have enough items for everyone to review. If you’re accepted to join the Product trial, we or the supplier will send you your product for review. If you’re unable to try the product within this timeframe, please wait for the next available invitation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>WHY HAVEN'T I RECEIVED ANY EMAILS SINCE REGISTERING?</b></p>
<p>We invite you to participate in specific trials based on the preferences you've shared with us, but also on a random basis. We, therefore, cannot guarantee that you'll be invited to trial every product that becomes available. This means occasionally there may be a gap of weeks, possibly months, before you hear from us.&nbsp; Please be aware that if we've confirmed your registration and you've verified your email address, you're a member of the Review Panel, and we'll be in touch as soon as suitable products are available for you to review.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>HOW OFTEN ARE THERE PRODUCTS AVAILABLE TO TRIAL AND REVIEW?</b></p>
<p>John Lewis runs campaigns regularly and products are available to trial every month.</p>
<p>The number of products in each of the campaigns is limited and John Lewis cannot guarantee all customers who received an email invitation to review new products will receive a product. Once products are confirmed, they will show in your dashboard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>I HAVE RECEIVED AN INVITATION TO TRIAL AND REVIEW A LARGE ITEM, FOR INSTANCE, A FRIDGE. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I REQUEST THIS KIND OF PRODUCT?</b></p>
<p>When requesting a large product, for instance, a large kitchen appliance, you will need to make sure you have sufficient space in your property and suitable electrical, gas or plumbing connections. John Lewis and suppliers are not able to provide any alterations to your existing furniture or installations at the time of delivering the product. If at the time of the delivery, John Lewis or our trusted suppliers inspect the connection and define it as unsafe, they reserve the right to reject the trial and <b>they won't be able to re-deliver the product</b>.</p>
</div></div><div class="cms-grid-col--d40e4 aem-kit-col" data-test="container"><div class="divider-whitespace-medium--58705"></div></div><div class="cms-grid-col--d40e4 aem-kit-col copy-wrapperContainer--b0c3a" data-test="container"><div class="copy-container--24150 copy-copy--f6b63 aem-kit-copy" data-test="copy"><p><b>&nbsp;WHAT HAPPENS IF I AM UNABLE TO REVIEW PRODUCTS?&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>As the programme relies on receiving reviews from our members, it’s important that all members participate in order to secure their place on the panel. Your honest feedback not only helps other customers but also helps inform our suppliers and contribute to product improvements. If you don't provide us with reviews you will be removed from the programme.If you do not want to participate simply email us at <a href="mailto:myjlreviewpanel@johnlewis.co.uk">myjlreviewpanel@johnlewis.co.uk</a> and we can remove you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>HOW SHOULD I WRITE MY REVIEW AND WHAT SHOULD I BE REVIEWING?</b></p>
<p>Please give your honest, unbiased opinion of the product(s) you have tried. Readers also love the practical information - for example, the product’s dimensions, how to use (with any handy tips you can add), and whether it's compatible with other products. If you receive beauty products, don't forget to include some insights into your personal beauty regime. With products that come as a set, such as a shampoo and conditioner, please review each product separately.</p>
<p>Please keep your reviews between 200 and 300 words or approximately 2,000 characters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>WHAT SHOULD I NOT INCLUDE IN MY REVIEWS?</b></p>
<p>There's no need to review standards of packaging, delivery or service as you'll receive your products directly from our suppliers and John Lewis. However, if for any reason, you would like to give feedback regarding your experience with one of our suppliers, simply email us at <a href="mailto:myjlreviewpanel@johnlewis.co.uk">myjlreviewpanel@johnlewis.co.uk</a>.</p>
<p>Please do not mention the price of the product or state that you bought the product yourself as you have received the product free of charge (this will be communicated via a badge next to your review). If you feel that a product is, or is not, worth its price, we suggest you write in terms of 'value for money', without directly mentioning the price.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>WHAT PICTURES SHOULD I SUBMIT?</b></p>
<p>When submitting a picture, please make sure these are of reasonable quality and they focus on the product. Your pictures are key in helping others when they are shopping so we suggest making them as professional and exciting as possible. If approved, your picture could be featured in one of our marketing campaigns and will appear on the John Lewis website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>HOW DO I SUBMIT A PICTURE/VIDEO?</b></p>
<p>At the stage you complete your review submissions form, you will be provided with the option to submit a picture and/or video. Simply upload your image and/or video as instructed to include it in your review.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>I HAVE SUBMITTED MY REVIEW BUT I CAN'T VIEW IT ON THE JOHNLEWIS.COM WEBSITE. WHY?</b></p>
<p>Please allow up to 72 hours to update. All reviews go through moderation before they are published on johnlewis.com</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>I HAVE SUBMITTED A PICTURE/VIDEO BUT I CAN'T VIEW IT ON THE JOHNLEWIS.CO.UK WEBSITE. WHY?</b></p>
<p>Images/videos and reviews are moderated separately and we can’t guarantee all pictures will be displayed on the website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>DO MEMBERS HAVE TO WRITE POSITIVE REVIEWS TO PARTICIPATE?</b></p>
<p>No. We expect our members to write unbiased, honest and authentic reviews.

For tips on writing a review please click <a href="/customer-services/shopping-with-us/ratings-and-reviews">here</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>DO MY JOHN LEWIS REVIEW MEMBERS GET PAID FOR WRITING REVIEWS?</b></p>
<p>No. We do not pay anyone to write reviews. There is no pressure or expectation to write positive reviews, and negative reviews do not affect membership in the programme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>ARE REVIEWS COLLECTED THROUGH THE MY JOHN LEWIS REVIEW PROGRAMME LABELLED DIFFERENTLY?</b></p>
<p>Yes. To ensure reviews are helpful and authentic, any reviews gathered through the My John Lewis Review Programme will display a badge with a review panel message and an indicator the product was received free of charge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>IT HAS BEEN A WEEK AND I STILL HAVEN'T RECEIVED MY PRODUCT. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?</b></p>
<p>Most of the products are sent within 5 working days from when the campaign ends. However, if you don't hear from a supplier within 2 weeks and the shipment information has not been shared with you, feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:myjlreviewpanel@johnlewis.co.uk">myjlreviewpanel@johnlewis.co.uk</a> and we will investigate this further. Before you get in touch, please check your email inbox to ensure no information has been shared with you.</p>
<p>Please note, for large items when a further contact is required to schedule a delivery, it might take up to a month to be contacted by one of our trusted suppliers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>WHAT HAPPENS AFTER I APPLY TO SAMPLE A PRODUCT?</b></p>
<p>Once you have requested your sample you will receive a confirmation email. Those who are most compatible with the product will then be selected to participate in the campaign. We are unable to guarantee that everyone who applies will receive a product to review.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>CAN I CHANGE MY PRODUCT SELECTION?</b></p>
<p>Once the product is selected you won’t be able to change your product selection. A campaign will close automatically as soon as all products have been requested. When requesting your product please read all information we shared with you via email inviting you to participate in the campaign to ensure you can comply with all campaign requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, there might be compatibility requirements for electronics that are only compatible with specific software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>CAN A SUPPLIER OR JOHN LEWIS CHANGE MY PRODUCT REQUEST?</b></p>
<p>We would love customers to write and post reviews as quickly as possible but it is important you have had the time to thoroughly use and test the product so that your review is really helpful to other customers.</p>
<p>We ask that you complete your review by the date provided by email. Failure to do so may result in you being removed from our review panel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>WHERE DO I POST MY REVIEW?</b></p>
<p>After you’ve received your product and the trial period has completed, we will send you an email with the instructions needed to complete your review. This will include a link to the submission form where you’ll be asked to write your review.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>WILL JOHN LEWIS EDIT MY REVIEW?</b></p>
<p>No. All My John Lewis Review Panel reviews will be posted on the relevant product page at johnlewis.com unedited, regardless of whether it is a favourable review or not, provided they follow our general moderation guidelines. For tips on writing a review please click <a href="/customer-services/shopping-with-us/ratings-and-reviews">here</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>WHERE AND WHEN WILL MY REVIEW APPEAR?</b></p>
<p>Reviews will appear on the product page relating to the product you have reviewed. Reviews from our Review Programme participants will be displayed a Review Programme logo. As all reviews go through a moderation process, please allow up to 72 hours between the time of submission to the review appearing on the product page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>IS THERE A LIMIT TO THE NUMBER OF MY JOHN LEWIS REVIEW PRODUCTS I CAN REQUEST FOR EACH CAMPAIGN?</b></p>
<p>For each campaign, we limit the available products to one per member. Occasionally there may be instances where more than one is available and will be accompanied with instructions on how to participate in these campaigns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>IF I DON'T SELECT ANY PRODUCTS FROM A CAMPAIGN, WILL I BE REMOVED FROM THE MY JOHN LEWIS REVIEW PROGRAMME?</b></p>
