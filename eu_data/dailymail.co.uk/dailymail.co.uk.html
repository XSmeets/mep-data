        The three-time Olympic champion opened up on his relationship with the father of his girlfriend&nbsp;Holly, who he met when they both took part on BBC's Strictly Come Dancing in 2021. Peaty admitted the 57-year-old had helped him in his recovery from alcoholism, depression and split from the mother of his son&nbsp;Eirianedd Munro, which culminated in 'three years of hell' for the swimmer. He told The Sunday Times the celebrity chef has emerged as a mentor and role model, who he looks up to for his 'relentless pursuit' and the way he has worked 'his way up to the upper echelons of his industry'.

      More than 800 people have signed a petition to get the travellers removed from a patch of land they own in Nantyglo, Monmouthshire (main), after the new arrivals began carving chunks out of the land, seemingly for the purposes of settling there. But the land has a covenant attached banning the construction of buildings on the site - and the local council has served the group with a stop notice ordering them to halt the works. The travellers (who arrived in caravans, inset) insist they are 'entitled' to dig up the land. Locals fear, however, that the works will disturb the fragile ground, which sits above historic mine shafts, and could spark a brand new Aberfan disaster, when a&nbsp;colliery spoil tip collapsed in 1966. The resulting landslip killed 144 people.

        Hailey Bieber's a fan. Amanda Seyfried has one. And Meghan and Harry are also thought to have the gadget in their kitchen.

                The National Crime Agency (NCA) said Ian Shacklady, 67, (middle) his partner Gillian Melville, 66, (left) and her son Alan Causer, 45, traded Class A drugs worth millions of pounds from their homes in Skelmersdale, Lancashire. At least 790lb (360kg) of cocaine and 55lb (25kg) of heroin were supplied by the family. Officers discovered nearly half a million pounds when they raided the home of Ian Shacklady and Gillian Melville - catching the mum red-handed. The organised crime group, led by son Alan Causer, was locked up for a combined total of more than 50 years today.

        They are scenes of domestic bliss. Unfortunately for Angela Rayner, they also contradict her repeated claims that the house in which the pictures were taken was not her home.

        I am 50 and have never married or had children (which I desperately wanted). I've had a few longer-term relationships in the past but they all ultimately failed.

        Local police have often explained the deaths as accidents or suicides, but many cases appear suspicious to family members of the deceased, and are often left insufficiently investigated.

                The first time Sydney Sweeney's father saw her naked in a graphic sex scene on HBO 's provocative television series Euphoria, he walked out of the room. Five years and many explicit sex scenes later, he is the proud father of one of Hollywood's hottest rising stars, with a recent hit in rom-com Anyone But You, Spider-Man spin-off ­Madame Web and starring this month as a pregnant nun in horror movie Immaculate. Still only 26, Sweeney produces her own films and is tipped to star in Marvel blockbuster Spider-Woman as well as being poised to remake Jane Fonda's brazenly libidinous 1968 sci-fi action movie Barbarella. But Sweeney has unexpectedly become more than an actress. The all-American blue-eyed blonde with corn-fed curves has become a cultural phenomenon, her unashamed sexuality embraced by America's conservative Right as proof that woke culture is dying, if not already dead.

                Saga Forsgren Elneborg, 20, was found strangled to death at home in the city of Örebro - in what prosecutors claim was an 'honour' killing because he was ashamed of having a baby with a non-Muslim. Now MailOnline has traced Ibrahim's mother and she has broken her silence to discuss the case for the first time - and deny her own anti-Swedish bigotry could explain what happened. Istar Yusuf Nuh, 42, instead insists she would have warmly received Saga into her family as well as the unborn baby son she was carrying when she was killed. The mother-of-three told us she did not have problems with her son dating a non-Muslim and that Saga's death had robbed her of a grandson she would have loved.

                Prince Andrew has been photographed giggling as a cheeky dog darts around his car while its owner chases it - just one day after the new drama, Scoop, aired on Netflix. Andrew was snapped looking relaxed in a Range Rover on the Long Walk in Windsor Castle today. However someone's dog, which appeared to be lost, ran around the 4x4 as Andrew appeared to be pointing at the canine. The pooches' owner was seen searching for his beloved pet - behind the royal's car. Andrew was then snapped chuckling as the man found his dog and walked over to the nearby grass. The Duke was seen cheerfully waving while the dog was secured.

        Incredibly, despite the fact that 274 suspected Nazis living in the UK were investigated, only one was ever convicted under the 1991 War Crimes Act. That individual was Anthony Sawoniuk.

       'It is still 90 seconds to midnight': the stark admission by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists in January 2024, marking the second year in a row the world's fate, according to the Doomsday Clock, has been held on such a precarious threshold. The war in Ukraine, North Korean peacocking and the breakdown of a deal with Iran to limit proliferation have all contributed to talk of the nuclear threat returning to headlines in recent years. Fear is exploited by the Russian propaganda machine, with Putin and his cronies&nbsp;repeating explicit warnings of Moscow's preparedness to use 'all available means' to protect her people should they feel threatened - and the possibility of 'accidental' Armageddon&nbsp;reaching London.

       BRIAN VINER: If I compiled my list again now I still wouldn't find room for The Italian Job, Forrest Gump, The Great Escape or Titanic, all of which moved readers to write in. That doesn't mean I don't like or even love those pictures, by the way (though not Titanic, which invariably makes me wish the iceberg would strike a bit sooner). Here then is your list of the Top 20 films you felt I should have included in my Top 100, and your reasons why... Pictured: The Shawshank Redemption (left), Mary Poppins (right) and Saving Private Ryan (inset).

                The body of Claire Boyle (pictured bottom, with then-partner Timothy Johnstone) was found after officers were called to a property on Main Street in Ochiltree, East Ayrshire, at around 7am on Thursday, April 4. Boyle, who was in her late 30s, had a number of previous convictions for child neglect. In February 2021, Kilmarnock Sheriff Court heard she neglected a four-year-old child so badly doctors feared he had blood cancer or a blood clotting disorder.

                Eighties pop icon Carol Decker (pictured, left) has blasted a bar for charging her&nbsp;£51.30 for four drinks and a bowl of nuts,&nbsp;including a £5.70 service charge. Decker, who was the lead singer of English pop group T'Pau, was left fuming when she received her bill at the Coppa Club in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire. The 66-year-old, who scored a number one hit with China in your Hand in 1987, had bought two pints of&nbsp;Beavertown Neck Oil IPA for £6.80 each and two glasses of Hanson Cuvee Rose at an eyewatering £14 a pop.

        Captain Moody and his crew had no idea why their engines had failed. All they knew was that their hulking jumbo jet was now effectively a giant glider heading fast towards the ground.

       Two lucky siblings bagged a huge farmhouse from a mystery relative, after fortune-finding experts successfully tracked down the unsuspecting heirs. Pam and Lawrence from Durham found out that a distant relative of theirs had died without leaving a will - leaving them as the rightful owners of a sprawling Welsh farm. At first, the pair were dubious, as they received a phone call naming a relative they'd never even heard of, and one who lived in Wales, a country they had no links to. But the good news was confirmed shortly after, and the pair first got to see their 18th century farmhouse in a heartwarming moment captured on Channel 4 's show Key to a Fortune. The property show, presented by A Place in the Sun host Jean Johansson reunites unsuspecting heirs with abandoned properties. Pictured above are the siblings.

                Bob Deller was a fit and healthy grand­father, who spent his time gardening, playing golf and going to yoga when he developed a nagging headache and started feeling dizzy last summer. His GP initially told him it was vertigo, a common condition that affects balance and generally improves on its own. But it was the beginning of a rapid deterioration that swiftly robbed the 75-year-old of his ability to talk and walk - and led to his death only four months later.

       A Virgin Atlantic 787 has collided with a British Airways Airbus A350 while pushing back from the terminal building at Heathrow airport causing minor damage to both aircraft. The Virgin jet was being guided by a tug when its winglets struck the horizontal stabiliser of the BA aircraft. The Virgin aircraft had no passengers on board and was being moved to a different part of the airport. However the BA A350 was due to be conducting BA flight BA81 to Accra, Ghana. The jet was due to depart London at 12.40pm but that has been pushed back to 6.30pm according to Heathrow Airport's latest information.

                Steve McCormack, who only bought his £132k farmhouse five years ago, but had to evacuate the historic property this week after the latest cliff fall. The three-bedroom house in Trimingham, Norfolk, will be demolished by the local council in the next few weeks to prevent it collapsing onto the beach below. A few feet away, Windy Ridge - a pristine chalet with a classic Triumph car outside belonging to Martin Collingwood, the former owner of Cliff Farm - faces a similar fate in the not-so-distant future. The retired carpenter, who previously served in the Parachute Regiment, vowed only death would part him from his sanctuary - despite its limited lifespan. 'This is my home. I won't go anywhere unless I leave in an old box, a coffin,' said the 69-year-old.

                When it comes to favourite outfits, why not get a little extra wear down the generations? This applies to royal mother-daughter pairings just as much as anyone else, including&nbsp; the late Queen and Princess Anne , Queen Mary of Denmark and Princess Isabella and Queen Letizia of Spain and daughter Princess Leonor . A number of royal women have created memorable twinning moments over recent years, as these pictures show.

                The masterminds behind the infamous Prince Andrew Newsnight interview are reportedly no longer on speaking terms. There is said to have been a falling out between journalist Emily Maitlis and ex Newsnight producer Sam McAlister who helped secure the interview. According to The Sun, the tension boils down to Emily, 53, not acknowledging the role Sam played in securing the interview with the prince.

                Mark Downey, 45, from Bolton, Manchester was struck with an excruciating headache causing a a 'stabbing pain' while driving with his family to a holiday in Wales in September 2023. The HGV driver, went to A&amp;E after painkillers were not helping, but left after he faced a 17 hour wait to see a doctor. After visiting his GP at home, who referred him for an MRI scan, he was eventually diagnosed with glioblastoma, a type of fast-growing brain tumour that can carry a life expectancy of just 12 to 18 months from diagnosis.

                She may have shot to fame for her hit song 'Shout' in 1964 - but Lulu recently revealed that she'll do anything but that before midday.&nbsp; In an interview with the BBC, the star, 75, from Glasgow, confessed that she won't utter a word before noon while she's touring. Lulu- who is about to embark on her final ever tour - said: 'I try not to come out of my room until 12. It makes it easier. I take care of my instrument. It allows me to sing.'&nbsp; But this isn't the only lifestyle quirk Lulu Kennedy-Cairns has developed during her 60 years in the spotlight. As Lulu embarks on her 'farewell' tour, FEMAIL reveals the 75-year-old's secrets for looking so youthful - including her 'stay slim strategy'.

                The other morning I woke from a bad dream filled with anxiety. The cause of my distress? I dreamed I was trying to squeeze into a pair of skinny jeans once more. I detest them nearly as much as my other fashion bête noire - floral frocks. Hence my determination to ignore the swirling reports that skinny jeans are making a return this year. Just when everyone had forgotten about them and was starting to look cool and relaxed in wide-leg and boyfriend jeans, the fashion industry decides to torment us all over again with these denim nasties.

       It was more than two decades ago that Lauren Goodger burst onto the reality scene in the inaugural series of The Only Way Is Essex (main, with Mark Wright).&nbsp; Perma-tanned, looking 'reem' and not afraid to tell anyone to 'Shuuuut uuuup!', she found instant fame alongside the likes of on/off boyfriend&nbsp;Mark, sisters&nbsp;Billie and Sam Faiers. Yet behind the scenes, it wasn't all glitz and glamour, with stars subjected to gruelling long days of filming and producers manipulating scenes to cause maximum drama. Speaking to MailOnline about the ITVBe show, Lauren revealed that things are very different now that she's returned after a 12-year absence and this certainly can be said of all reality shows.

                Claudia Schiffer and Matthew Vaughn have scrapped plans to install electric plugs at their £7.5m Tudor mansion over fears they could damage panelling made from ancient oak. The catwalk queen and her film-director husband applied for listed building consent for a partial refit&nbsp;of Coldham Hall in Stanningfield, West Sussex. They asked permission for four new plug sockets in the first floor living room of the historic mansion.

                Lord Frederick Windsor turns 45 today, April 6, but his journey towards a settled life has been far from smooth. There was a time when the son of Prince and Princess Michael of Kent was known&nbsp; as a confirmed hedonist. 'He was constantly surrounded by girls, was chucking back vintage Krug and had a fag permanently hanging out of his mouth,' said one observer from his younger days. At one point, Lord Frederick's parents even made him visit a drugs rehabilitation clinic to warn him about the potential consequences.

        There's growing fears amongst royal fans and experts alike that King Charles' idea of a slimmed-down British monarchy could doom the Crown to&nbsp;irrelevance.

                An ex-prisoner, who was inspired by Kate Middleton to quit a life of crime, has told the cancer-hit Princess of Wales (pictured, left):&nbsp;'Please keep fighting - you won't let it beat you'. Francesca Fattore (pictured, right, with Kate), 44, had a meeting with the princess when the royal was visiting HMP Send in Surrey after passing a 12-week rehab programme. Now the ex-con, who lives in Reading, has sent words of support to the Princess of Wales, who announced she had cancer on March 22. In an interview with the Mirror , she urged Kate to 'always remember: You haven't got to live with cancer, cancer has to live with you - and you won't let it beat you.'

However, behind the dazzling facade lies a darker reality that has become a rather common. highly-publicised theme among sporting legends and their spouses: infidelity.

Suzi, 52, was married to Ian Walker, 52, the former goalkeeper for Tottenham Hotspur and England, for twelve years - they also have a daughter together called Sophie, who is now 24.

                From thickening shampoos to vitamin gummies and hair transplants, there's a whole industry thriving off the stress of men losing their locks. But those daunted by the natural change need to look no further than the man known as Turkish from Snatch or Frank Martin from The Transporter- Jason Statham. After he lost his brunette tresses, Jason, 56, became one of the hottest properties in Hollywood after starring in Guy Ritchie 's 1998 Look, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, and bagged an even hotter fiance, Rosie Huntington Whitely. (Pictured from L to R: Jason at the 1990 Commonwealth Games in Auckland, in Snatch, in Revolver, with fiance, Rosie Huntington-Whitely.)

       Mount Etna put on a spectacular show for astonished tourists as they watched the volcano blow smoke rings into the sky. The rare phenomenon - known as volcanic smoke rings - can only form in a circular volcanic vent and requires a calm atmosphere. Despite the name, the rings are not technically made of smoke, instead they are made of condensed gases, mainly water vapour, that has escaped the magma and shot up from the volcano's vent.

                If Cole Palmer isn't already a household name, the onus is on the household to get with the times. We're looking at a man who could play a defining role in the next decade of English football and beyond. Not many 21-year-olds brush aside Manchester United, but Palmer does what he likes. His hat-trick for Chelsea against the Red Devils on Thursday night once again saw him stray into the headlines. Who is this seemingly shy, matter-of-fact chap, and what are his origins? Players like this don't just spawn out of the ether. He has a fascinating story, from his family's extraordinary journey from the Caribbean to English shores, to being a boyhood Man United fan and then playing for Manchester City .

                Mesut Ozil has stunned football fans in recent weeks with a stunning body transformation after he posted videos and photos of his new physique on social media. He's not the only player to have bulked up after retirement. The former Arsenal midfielder retired from football last year at the age of 34 and has not kept it secret that the gym is now his second home after leaving the game. He is not the only player who has turned to weights, though, following the conclusion of his career. Former Liverpool and Chelsea striker Fernando Torres also switched his lean physique for a sizeable one, which certainly surprised many. Perhaps one of the most infamous body transformations came from former Werder Bremen goalkeeper Tim Wiese when he switched the football pitch for the WWE. Amongst these three players there are others, Mail Sport takes a look at former stars of the game who have&nbsp;put serious hours into the gym following retirement.

        Anyone who grew up in the noughties will be familiar with the British boybands McFly and Busted. Their eponymous album reached its peak at number nine on the charts.

                British tennis player Emma Raducanu (pictured) was seen enjoying a night out with friends yesterday after she was photographed&nbsp;leaving Gaia in Mayfair. The snaps come as the tennis ace - who was recently forced to pull out of the Miami Open with a back injury - confirmed she will be back on court next week at the Billie Jean King Cup in France. Emma was seen smiling during the intimate night out, and dressed casually but stylishly in white straight cut trousers with a matching white shirt. She paired the all-white ensemble with a black jacket, and a pair of sports chic flat maroon loafers. Meanwhile, she opted for a fresh-faced look, and wore her long black tresses loose, letting them tumble down her back.

For example, a vendor or publisher might need to store a cookie on your device during your first visit on a website, to be able to recognise your device during your next visits (by accessing this cookie each time).&quot;]},&quot;2&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:2,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Use limited data to select advertising&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times an ad is presented to you).&quot;,&quot;illustrations&quot;:[&quot;A car manufacturer wants to promote its electric vehicles to environmentally conscious users living in the city after office hours. The advertising is presented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change actions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that they are in an urban zone.&quot;,&quot;A large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online advertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its audience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and avoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles about how to paint your house). The number of times that the ad has been presented to you is detected and limited, to avoid presenting it too often.&quot;]},&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:3,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Create profiles for personalised advertising&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Information about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit, content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (that might include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present advertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by this and other entities.&quot;,&quot;illustrations&quot;:[&quot;If you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this information could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike accessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a different website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike accessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury car manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your interest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are interested in luxury cycling gear.&quot;,&quot;An apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It gets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income customers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create profiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to have a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising within partner apps based on those profiles.&quot;]},&quot;4&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:4,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Use profiles to select personalised advertising&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising profiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or apps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects.&quot;,&quot;illustrations&quot;:[&quot;An online retailer wants to advertise a limited sale on running shoes. It wants to target advertising to users who previously looked at running shoes on its mobile app. Tracking technologies might be used to recognise that you have previously used the mobile app to consult running shoes, in order to present you with the corresponding advertisement on the app.&quot;,&quot;A profile created for personalised advertising in relation to a person having searched for bike accessories on a website can be used to present the relevant advertisement for bike accessories on a mobile app of another organisation.&quot;]},&quot;5&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:5,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Create profiles to personalise content&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Information about your activity on this service (for instance, forms you submit, non-advertising content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (such as your previous activity on this service or other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (which might for example include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present content that appears more relevant based on your possible interests, such as by adapting the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find content that matches your interests.&quot;,&quot;illustrations&quot;:[&quot;You read several articles on how to build a treehouse on a social media platform. This information might be added to a profile to mark your interest in content related to outdoors as well as do-it-yourself guides (with the objective of allowing the personalisation of content, so that for example you are presented with more blog posts and articles on treehouses and wood cabins in the future).&quot;,&quot;You have viewed three videos on space exploration across different TV apps. An unrelated news platform with which you have had no contact builds a profile based on that viewing behaviour, marking space exploration as a topic of possible interest for other videos.&quot;]},&quot;6&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:6,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Use profiles to select personalised content&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Content presented to you on this service can be based on your content personalisation profiles, which can reflect your activity on this or other services (for instance, the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects. This can for example be used to adapt the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find (non-advertising) content that matches your interests.&quot;,&quot;illustrations&quot;:[&quot;You read articles on vegetarian food on a social media platform and then use the cooking app of an unrelated company. The profile built about you on the social media platform will be used to present you vegetarian recipes on the welcome screen of the cooking app.&quot;,&quot;You have viewed three videos about rowing across different websites. An unrelated video sharing platform will recommend five other videos on rowing that may be of interest to you when you use your TV app, based on a profile built about you when you visited those different websites to watch online videos.&quot;]},&quot;7&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:7,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Measure advertising performance&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.&quot;,&quot;illustrations&quot;:[&quot;You have clicked on an advertisement about a “black Friday” discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.&quot;,&quot;You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.&quot;]},&quot;8&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:8,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Measure content performance&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Information regarding which content is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine whether the (non-advertising) content e.g. reached its intended audience and matched your interests. For instance, whether you read an article, watch a video, listen to a podcast or look at a product description, how long you spent on this service and the web pages you visit etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of (non-advertising) content that is shown to you. &quot;,&quot;illustrations&quot;:[&quot;You have read a blog post about hiking on a mobile app of a publisher and followed a link to a recommended and related post. Your interactions will be recorded as showing that the initial hiking post was useful to you and that it was successful in interesting you in the related post. This will be measured to know whether to produce more posts on hiking in the future and where to place them on the home screen of the mobile app.&quot;,&quot;You were presented a video on fashion trends, but you and several other users stopped watching after 30 seconds. This information is then used to evaluate the right length of future videos on fashion trends.&quot;]},&quot;9&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:9,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Understand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different sources&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Reports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).&quot;,&quot;illustrations&quot;:[&quot;The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.&quot;,&quot;An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.&quot;]},&quot;10&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:10,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Develop and improve services&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Information about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with ads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to build new products and services based on user interactions, the type of audience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or improvement of user profiles and identifiers.&quot;,&quot;illustrations&quot;:[&quot;A technology platform working with a social media provider notices a growth in mobile app users, and sees based on their profiles that many of them are connecting through mobile connections. It uses a new technology to deliver ads that are formatted for mobile devices and that are low-bandwidth, to improve their performance.&quot;,&quot;An advertiser is looking for a way to display ads on a new type of consumer device. It collects information regarding the way users interact with this new kind of device to determine whether it can build a new mechanism for displaying advertising on this type of device.&quot;]},&quot;11&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:11,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Use limited data to select content&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Content presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type, or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times a video or an article is presented to you).&quot;,&quot;illustrations&quot;:[&quot;A travel magazine has published an article on its website about the new online courses proposed by a language school, to improve travelling experiences abroad. The school’s blog posts are inserted directly at the bottom of the page, and selected on the basis of your non-precise location (for instance, blog posts explaining the course curriculum for different languages than the language of the country you are situated in).&quot;,&quot;A sports news mobile app has started a new section of articles covering the most recent football games. Each article includes videos hosted by a separate streaming platform showcasing the highlights of each match. If you fast-forward a video, this information may be used to select a shorter video to play next.&quot;]}},&quot;specialPurposes&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:1,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Ensure security, prevent and detect fraud, and fix errors\n&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Your data can be used to monitor for and prevent unusual and possibly fraudulent activity (for example, regarding advertising, ad clicks by bots), and ensure systems and processes work properly and securely. It can also be used to correct any problems you, the publisher or the advertiser may encounter in the delivery of content and ads and in your interaction with them.&quot;,&quot;illustrations&quot;:[&quot;An advertising intermediary delivers ads from various advertisers to its network of partnering websites. It notices a large increase in clicks on ads relating to one advertiser, and uses data regarding the source of the clicks to determine that 80% of the clicks come from bots rather than humans.&quot;]},&quot;2&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:2,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Deliver and present advertising and content&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Certain information (like an IP address or device capabilities) is used to ensure the technical compatibility of the content or advertising, and to facilitate the transmission of the content or ad to your device.&quot;,&quot;illustrations&quot;:[&quot;Clicking on a link in an article might normally send you to another page or part of the article. To achieve this, 1°) your browser sends a request to a server linked to the website, 2°) the server answers back (“here is the article you asked for”), using technical information automatically included in the request sent by your device, to properly display the information / images that are part of the article you asked for.
