<h2>9. How we protect your information</h2>

<p>We take protecting your information seriously. We follow a comprehensive information-security program and use technical and organisational measures, such as two-step verification, encryption, <span data-cardopen="false" data-cardtext="The process of making information pseudonymous." data-cardtitle="Pseudonymisation" role="button" tabindex="0">pseudonymisation</span> and ongoing security training for our employees, to protect your information. We also continually evaluate emerging threats, the latest security technologies and best practices.</p>

<p>When you contact us, we will ask you to provide certain information so we can confirm your identity and your right to access the account. This is to make sure your account and associated information are protected from unauthorised access.</p>

&nbsp;

<div class="mainAccordion-info">
<div class="bulletBackground">
<p>We generally store your information for as long as is necessary for:</p>

<ul><li>the purposes described in section 6 of this privacy policy</li>
	<li>other legitimate purposes, such as meeting our legal obligations and enforcing our terms of service, and</li>
	<li>security purposes.</li>

<p>In some cases, we store your information for longer (for example when we need to keep to legal requirements).</p>

</div>

<div aria-labelledby="Mainheader1" class="mainAccordion-answer" id="Mainpanel" role="region">
<div class="bulletBackground">
<p>The period we keep your information for depends on factors such as:</p>

<ul><li>the type of information</li>
	<li>why it has been collected and is being processed</li>
	<li>business needs (for example, creating backups so we can restore our services after a disaster), and</li>
	<li>any legal requirements we must keep to.</li>
</ul></div>

<p>For example, we keep the content of your email account for as long as your account is active. To keep your account active you must log in at least once every 12 months. If your account becomes inactive, your mailbox will be automatically deleted and cannot be restored. If your account continues to be inactive for a further six months, making it inactive for a total of 18 months, your account will be automatically scheduled for deactivation and deletion by our systems. We will tell you using your alternative communications channel (if you have set one up) before this happens.</p>

<p>Please note that paid subscriber accounts remain active during the subscription period regardless of account activity.</p>
