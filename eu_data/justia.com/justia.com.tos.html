    <strong>
        1. TERMS OF SERVICE (TOS) ACCEPTANCE
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Welcome to Justia. Justia offers a number of informational Web sites and provides a number of Web services ("Service"). Your use of the Service (including any of the content or any services offered) is subject to these Terms of Service ("TOS"). 
</p>
<p>
    We may modify this TOS at any time without notice to you by posting revised TOS on our sites. You can review the most current version of the TOS at any time at: <a href="https://www.justia.com/terms-of-service/">https://www.justia.com/terms-of-service/</a>
</p>
<p>
    Your use of the Service constitutes your binding acceptance of the TOS, including any modifications that we make. This Agreement will constitute a binding and enforceable agreement between you (individually and in your individual capacity as an employee, officer, agent, partner, etc. of each organization you represent in connection with any use of the Service) and Justia. By using the Service or any Services, you acknowledge and agree that you have fully read and agree to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement, exactly as if it were printed on paper and signed by you. If you do not agree to be bound by this Agreement in its entirety, then you must immediately stop using the Justia Web site and all Services. Although the registration process may require you to "click-through" or otherwise affirmatively agree to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement is binding on you by your use of the Justia Web site or Services, regardless of whether or not you choose to register. 
</p>
<p>
    Where you use the Service in the course of your employment or business, you enter into this Agreement both on your own behalf and in your individual capacity as an employee, officer, agent, partner, etc. of such organization which you represent, and references in this Agreement to "you" shall mean both you as the individual user of the Service and you in your capacity as a representative of your organization. 
</p>
<p>
    In addition, when using particular Justia owned or operated services, you and Justia shall be subject to any posted guidelines or rules applicable to such services which may be posted from time to time. All such guidelines or rules are hereby incorporated by reference into the TOS. 
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Service currently provides users with access to a collection of content and services, including legal information, educational information and services, Internet search services, marketing information, marketing services, hosted Web sites and business information through its network of properties. 
</p>
<p>
    You also understand and agree that the Service may include advertisements and that these advertisements are necessary for Justia to provide the Service. Free Web site's on Justia's Justia.net service may have search functionality provided by a third party service. A search box providing this search functionality may be placed anywhere on a Web page, including the top of the Web page. Any search that takes place on the Justia.net Web site may lead to a search results page on the third party site which may include advertisements. This advertising revenue will be split between the third party search provider and Justia. Justia will also include links on the free Justia.net Web sites to Justia and other online Web sites. These links may be in the header, footer, Web Resources Page or Web Blog page. In addition Justia reserves the right to place paid advertisements on the Justia.net under the footer of the Web site's pages. 
</p>
<p>
    You also understand and agree that the Service may include certain communications from Justia, such as service announcements, administrative messages and the Justia Newsletter, and that these communications are considered part of Justia membership and you will not be able to opt out of receiving them. 
</p>
<p>
Justia may promote benefits offered by third parties. Justia is not responsible for any products or services, or any discounts, provided by these third parties.
</p>
<p>
    Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new Justia properties, shall be subject to the TOS. 
</p>
<p>
    You understand and agree that the Service is provided "AS-IS" and that Justia assumes no responsibility for the timeliness, deletion, mis-delivery or failure to store any user communications or personalization settings. You are responsible for obtaining access to the Service and that access may involve third party fees (such as Internet service provider or airtime charges). You are responsible for those fees, including those fees associated with the display or delivery of advertisements. In addition, you must provide and are responsible for all equipment necessary to access the Service. 
</p>
<p>
    We have the right, but not the obligation, to take any of the following actions in our sole discretion at any time and for any reason without giving you any prior notice: 
</p>
<p>
    a. Restrict, suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Service; b. Change, suspend or discontinue all or any part of the Service; c. Refuse, move or remove any material that you submit to the Service for any reason; d. Refuse, move, or remove any content that is available on the Service; e. Deactivate or delete your accounts and all related information and files in your account; f. Establish general practices and limits concerning use of the Service 
</p>
<p>
    You agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for taking any of these actions. 
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        3. YOUR REGISTRATION OBLIGATIONS

        27. GENERAL INFORMATION
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Entire Agreement
    </strong>
    <br>
    The TOS constitutes the entire agreement between you and Justia and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Justia. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use or purchase certain other Justia services, affiliate services, third-party content or third-party software. 
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Choice of Law and Forum
    </strong>
    <br>
    The TOS and the relationship between you and Justia shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You and Justia agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California. 
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Arbitration
    </strong>
    <br>
    Justia may elect to resolve any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these TOS or our sites by binding arbitration in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association. Any such controversy or claim shall be arbitrated on an individual basis, and shall not be consolidated in any arbitration with any claim or controversy of any other party. The arbitration shall be conducted in the county of Santa Clara, California, and judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Either you or we may seek any interim or preliminary relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in the county of Santa Clara, California, necessary to protect the rights or property of you or Justia (or its agents, suppliers, and subcontractors) pending the completion of arbitration. 
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Waiver and Severability of Terms
    </strong>
    <br>
    The failure of Justia to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOS shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the TOS is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the TOS remain in full force and effect. 
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        No Right of Survivorship and Non-Transferability
    </strong>
    <br>
    You agree that your Justia account is non-transferable and any rights to your Justia I.D. or contents within your account terminate upon your death. Upon receipt of a copy of a death certificate, your account may be terminated and all contents therein permanently deleted. 
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Statute of Limitations
    </strong>
    <br>
    You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or the TOS must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. 
</p>
<p>
    The section titles in the TOS are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
