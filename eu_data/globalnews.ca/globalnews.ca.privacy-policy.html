<p>If you provide us with information about another individual, we will assume that you are authorized to do so and that you have obtained that individual’s consent for the collection, use or disclosure of that information for the purposes set out in this policy.</p>
<p>Regardless of how we obtain your consent, you may withdraw it at any time (see “Withdrawal of Consent” under “Requests about your personal information” below). Please note that in some circumstances, it may not be possible for us to provide (or continue to provide) products or services to you without your consent to collect, use, store and/or disclose your personal information.</p>
<p>We do not require your consent in some situations specified by law, such as when the use of personal information is necessary for the provision of a service requested by you, the prevention and detection of fraud or the evaluation and improvement of protection and security measures, or when it is clearly used for your benefit (like a medical emergency or a threat to your safety).</p>

Depending on the context, we may need to collect personal information from you to allow us to provide you with our products and services, or for other legitimate purposes outlined below, at the time of collection, or as otherwise permitted by law. We only collect, use, and retain personal information to the extent necessary to carry out our intended purposes.</p>
<p>The following are common examples where we may collect your personal information:</p>
<ol>
<li><b> </b><strong><b>Contests</b></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We administer public contests.</p>
<p>As part of contest entry, we may ask you for personal information such as your name, address, postal code, or age.</p>
<p>We collect this personal information from you to: facilitate your contest entry, confirm your eligibility, distribute contest prizes, track compliance with official rules and regulations, and improve our products and services.</p>
<p>We will only publish a contest winner’s name and/or photograph after receiving prior written consent from the winner and the appropriate, fully completed release forms. If a parent or guardian enters a contest on behalf of a child who is under the age of majority in their province of residence, we will only publish the minor’s name and/or photograph after the parent or guardian takes an active step to confirm consent and we receive fully completed release forms from them.</p>
<ol>
<li><b> </b><strong><b>Newsletters, club memberships, news alerts and promotional subscriptions</b></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We offer many ways for our customers and audiences to engage with us, including by subscribing to newsletters, club memberships, news alerts and promotions.</p>
<p>We may ask you to provide us with personal information such as your name, e-mail address, postal code, or age in order to administer your subscription and serve content and advertising to you.</p>
<p>We may also collect information about you such as demographic data, opinions, preferences, and interactions with our and our partners’ platforms and services in order to offer you content, products and services that are more relevant for you.</p>
<ol>
<li><b> </b><strong><b>Product and service accounts</b></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We offer various products and services that may require you to set up a user account.</p>
<p>In those cases, we may collect information such as your name, e-mail address, postal code, or age, in order to administer your account. Additionally, if your account includes paid transactions, we may collect payment information such as credit card details and billing address.</p>
<p>We may also collect information about you such as demographic data, opinions, preferences, and interactions with our and our partners’ platforms and services in order to offer you content, products and services that are more relevant for you.</p>
<p>Some of our applications (for example, Global TV, Global News, Skytracker) may collect location data to provide local weather updates, alerts, warnings, to restrict access to content where required by territorial rights restrictions, or for advertising or marketing purposes.</p>
<ol>
<li><b> </b><strong><b>Direct communication about programming and accessibility</b></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>In some cases, you may communicate directly with us in relation to our programming, including when participating in interactive program segments (such as calling in to a talk radio program) and providing feedback or expressing concerns to us about a program segment after it airs. In those cases, we may collect personal information from you (such as name, e-mail address, phone number or mailing address, as applicable) for purposes of establishing your identity.</p>
<p>You may also want to provide feedback regarding the accessibility of our services in any area of our business. In those cases, we may collect the details of the channel of communication used: &nbsp;email address in case you choose to provide it to us when you fill out the applicable web form, email address if the communication was sent by email, telephone number in case you choose to provide a phone number to call you back, mailing address if provided.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, depending on the circumstances, we may also collect from you the following information in order to ascertain if there is a technical problem: city or province you are located in, the name of your cable or other provider, how you access our station (e.g., satellite, cable, streaming), name of the program you watched and time, or the cable box that you were using if you were watching via cable.</p>
<ol>
<li><b> </b><strong><b>In-person attendance to our events or visiting our premises</b></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You may attend one of our premises or a public event we are hosting or sponsoring. In those cases, we may collect personal information, such as your name, for registration, security, identity verification, health, and safety reasons and, where appropriate, for subsequent communication. The personal information collected will depend on the nature of the attendance or event.</p>
<p>Our premises are under video surveillance for security purposes, and we will make and keep video recordings for such security purposes.</p>
<ol>
<li><b> </b><strong><b>Research and marketing studies</b></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We occasionally conduct research studies and/or focus groups involving volunteer participants to inform our business strategies and understand our audience, for example, on program scheduling preferences, engagement with our products or services or trends in audience preferences. For these purposes, we may collect personal information, such as demographic data, preferences or interests.</p>
<p>The personal information collected in connection with a research study or focus group will depend on the nature of the underlying study.</p>
<ol>
<li><b> </b><strong><b>Fulfilling a transaction</b></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We may need to collect personal information from you, such as your name, phone number, email address, or billing address, to fulfill a transaction between us and you, for example, if you purchase a ticket for one of our events.</p>
<p>The personal information collected will depend on the nature of the transaction.</p>
<ol>
<li><b> </b><strong><b>Online Feedback, Email Submission, Notifications, and Social Sharing</b></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you send an e-mail to us or fill out our “feedback” form through one of our Sites, we will collect your e-mail address and the full content of your e-mail, including attached files, and other information you provide.</p>
<p>We may use and display your full name and email address when you send an email notification to a friend through one of our Sites, or the social network from which you have connected to the website or application (such as in an invitation, or when sharing your content).</p>
<ol>
<li><b> </b><strong><b>Visiting or using our Sites</b></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When you visit or use our Sites, we may collect information about the computer or device you use and how you interact with our Sites including Internet Protocol (IP) address, device identifiers, operating system, browser type, screen resolution,&nbsp; content you viewed or listened to, pages visited, and interactions with buttons or other website controls. We do this to help analyze, operate, and improve the functioning of the Sites. We also use it to help determine the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing, perform analytics, conduct research, learn about the characteristics of our audiences, record tendencies and preferences for easier use of the Sites, perform accounting, auditing, and other internal functions, and provide you with content and advertisements that are more tailored to your interests.</p>
<p>For the above purposes, we may also collect data across your smartphone, tablet, desktop computer or other connected devices (cross-device data). For more information, refer to the “Cookies and Online Interest Based Advertising” section below.</p>
<p>Additionally, when you seek to access age-gated content on one of our Sites, we may request information about your date of birth to establish that you are old enough to access the content.</p>
<ol>
<li><b> </b><strong><b>SMS and push notifications</b></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If we offer SMS notification or push notification functionality, and you choose to receive SMS notifications and/or push notifications, we may send such notifications to your mobile device. We will collect and store the information you provide, including your telephone number. You can opt out of receiving SMS and push notifications and you can adjust the types of notifications you receive by editing your notification settings on your mobile device (see “Withdrawal of Consent” below). We will not charge a fee to use SMS notifications or push notifications, but any text messages sent and/or received are subject to standard text messaging rates. Additionally, text messages sent and/or received count towards a monthly quota as any other messages do. Any users, whether sending or receiving text messages, should be aware that standard text messaging rates may apply. Text messaging rates can normally be found by asking your mobile carrier.</p>
<ol>
<li><b> </b><strong><b>Show/content submissions</b></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Occasionally, you will have the opportunity to submit ideas or content such as videos or audio for inclusion on one of our Sites. At the time of submission, you may be asked to include your name, contact number, email, or address. Only those who produce the show in question and designated support staff will have access to the contact information and it will not be passed on to a third party. People who submit ideas or content may be contacted if the show’s producers are interested in using idea submissions.</p>
<ol>
<li><b> </b><strong><b>Chat forums</b></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Our Sites may, from time-to-time, feature forums (such as message boards and chat rooms) which enable our users to communicate with each other. We do not moderate and are not responsible for the content that you or any user posts on any forum on the Site. All personal information you post in a forum becomes public information and may be viewed, collected, and used by any visitor to the Site, and may expose you to unsolicited messages. This is beyond our control. Therefore, we strongly recommend that you do not post any personal information on any forum that you do not wish to disclose to others.</p>
<ol>
<li><b> </b><strong><b>“Refer A Friend” Or “Sharing” Features</b></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you choose to use a referral service to “tell a friend” about the website, a specific article or feature on the website, or a contest that is running, we may ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will then send your friend an email on your behalf inviting them to visit the content which you have shared. We store your friend’s name and email for a short period for the sole purpose of sending this email and for redundancy checking, to be sure that your friend does not receive multiple copies of the same email message. We do not keep or use this information for any other purpose.</p>
<p>In the event that you provide your friend’s name and email address, you represent that you have their consent, and you agree to provide them with the information contained in this Privacy Policy, exempting us from any liability in this regard. However, we may carry out the necessary verifications to verify this fact, adopting the corresponding due diligence measures, in accordance with applicable law.</p>
<ol>
<li><b> </b><strong><b>Social Media Campaigns</b></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We may collect personal information from you for execution of our social media campaigns, such as name, email address or your device ID.</p>
<p>The relevant social media platform may collect your personal information separately from us. Please review the “ When do we link to our business partners’ and third- party content/websites?” section below for more information.</p>
<ol>
<li><b> </b><strong><b>Tailored Content and Advertising</b></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When you engage with us, we may collect certain information, such as your gender, age range, device ID number, e-mail address, IP address, postal code, or location data, and combine them with data from other sources to better understand your preferences and provide you with a more tailored experience and relevant advertising.</p>
<p>For example, when you subscribe to our newsletters, enter our contests, or download our apps, we may collect this information and combine it with your usage activities (such as browsing, viewing habits or app usage) when you watch our programming through our owned and operated platforms (such as the Global TV app) or our partner platforms (for example, StackTV on Amazon, Rogers, and Fubo TV, or Pluto TV), and with aggregated demographic data from our own and our partner organizations. We may also combine this data from a third-party source to support various forms of segmentation for marketing and advertising purposes, content, or experience personalization.</p>
<p>Our analysis of your personal information may involve automated decisions, wherein software processes your data along with other factors to present you with more pertinent content and advertisements.</p>
<p>We will always comply with an applicable privacy legislation and industry best practices and standards &nbsp;before using your information in this way, and you can opt out at any time if you change your mind. See “Withdrawal of Consent” below for more information.</p>
