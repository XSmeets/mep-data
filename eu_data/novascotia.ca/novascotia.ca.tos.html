  <h1>Terms of Use</h1>

<div id="summary"><p>When you use or register for any of government’s websites, web applications or web communications, you’re agreeing to comply with these terms.</p>
</div>

<div class="introduction"><p>When you use or register for any of government’s websites, web applications or web communications, you’re agreeing to comply with these terms.</p></div>



          <h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Please add your comments to this site -- we’re very interested in what you have to say.
Government wants discussion sections to be a good experience for everyone, so here are a few simple guidelines
to keep in mind.</p>

<ul>
<li>be respectful -- no personal shots or defamatory statements.</li>
<li>avoid partisan comments. This is a place to discuss policies and initiatives of the
provincial government, not a political party. There are lots of other places to voice your political
preferences</li>
<li>express your own opinion</li>
<li>treat others as you would treat a guest in your home, with courtesy
All discussions are moderated, which means that inflammatory or otherwise inappropriate posts will be
removed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<p>For the purposes of these terms of use, the following definitions will apply:</p>

<h3>content</h3>

<p>means all information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages, or
any other materials whatsoever</p>

<h3>offensive</h3>

<p>with reference to language, material, content or any other type of submission means obscene, indecent,
defamatory, abusive, bullying, harassing, racist, hateful, or violent. It includes but is not limited to ethnic
slurs, religious intolerance, and homophobic or personal attacks</p>

<h3>government</h3>

<p>means the Government of Nova Scotia</p>

<h2>Monitoring</h2>

<p>Government tries to provide a useful and positive online experience for users, so it makes reasonable efforts to
monitor activity on the website in forums, blogs, wikis, etc., to encourage compliance with this Terms of
Use. However, government does not make any warranties or guarantees that the website, or any
portion thereof, will be constantly monitored for accuracy or unacceptable use; or that apparent statements of fact will be authenticated; or that you will never come across any offensive content.
Please contact government if you come across offensive content.</p>

<h2>Moderation</h2>

<p>All submitted content is subject to moderation. Moderators may approve, edit, or reject content before
it appears, sometimes causing a delay in the appearance of your submission/post/content. Moderators
may edit or delete your submission/post/content after it has been posted if in our sole discretion it
violates the Terms of use. This discretion includes a moderator’s determination of whether posted
material is offensive. Moderators may close discussion on a given topic or on any area of the website if
it is deemed off-topic or to be no longer useful. Moderators may choose to move a discussion to a more
appropriate area if the discussion is off-topic in the area in which it is occurring.</p>

<h2>Use of user ID and password</h2>

<p>You are solely responsible for all usage or activity on your account. Government requires you to take reasonable
efforts to ensure your ID and username are protected and not used without your knowledge or consent
or on your behalf by others.</p>

<h2>Use of the website by you</h2>

<p>Each user must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with the use of any content, including any reliance
on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such content.</p>

<p>Under no circumstances will government be liable in any way for any content, including, but not limited
to, liability for any errors or omissions in any content or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a
result of the use of any content posted, emailed or otherwise transmitted via government’s websites.</p>

<p>Government does not control user-supplied content posted to the websites and, as such, does not guarantee
the accuracy, integrity or quality of such content. Content, whether publicly posted or privately
transmitted, is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such content originated. This means
that the user, and not government, is entirely responsible for all content that he or she uploads, posts,
emails or otherwise transmits via the website. No user shall transmit content or otherwise conduct or
participate in any activities on government’s websites that, in the judgment of government, is likely to
be prohibited by law in any applicable jurisdiction, including laws governing the encryption of software,
the export of technology, the transmission of obscenity, or the permissible uses of intellectual property.</p>

<p>You may not provide to or post on or through the website any graphics, text, photographs, images,
video, audio or other material that constitutes unsolicited junk mail, spam, advertising, commercial
offers, or attempts at deception or fraud. You may not repeat the same posting multiple times in a day
or week.</p>

<p>You agree not to use offensive language or to provide to or post on or through the website any graphics,
text, photographs, images, video, audio or other material that is offensive when using the website.</p>

<p>You are responsible for ensuring that any graphics, text, photographs, images, video, audio or other
material you provide to or post on the website, including without limitation in forums, blogs, wikis, and
chats does not violate the copyright, trademark, trade secret or any other personal or proprietary rights
of any third party or is provided or posted with the permission of the owner(s) of such rights.</p>

<h2>Comments by others are not endorsed by government</h2>

<p>Government does not endorse, support, sanction, encourage, verify, or agree with the comments,
opinions, or statements posted on forums, blogs, wikis, chats, or otherwise contained in the website.
Any information or material placed online, including advice and opinions, are the views and
responsibility of those who post the statements and do not represent the views of government.</p>

<h2>Use of material supplied by you</h2>

<p>For information regarding use of information about you that you may supply or communicate to the
website, please see our <a href="/privacy/">Privacy statement</a>. Except as expressly provided otherwise in the Privacy
statement, in this Terms of Use, or as stated on specific pages, you agree that by posting messages,
uploading text, graphics, photographs, images, video or audio files, inputting data, or engaging in any
other form of communication with or through the website, you grant government a royalty-free, perpetual, non-
exclusive, unrestricted, worldwide licence to use and modify or adapt in order to reproduce any such
communication in any medium now in existence or hereinafter developed. In addition, please be aware
that information you disclose in publicly accessible portions of the website will be available to all users
of the website, so you should be mindful of personal information and other content you may wish to
post. Certain sites and pages may waive this grant and not claim any rights over material submitted by
you. Such pages and sites will provide clear notice of this.</p>

<p>Government shall have the right (but not the obligation) in its sole discretion to refuse or delete any
content that it reasonably considers to be offensive, that violates the Terms of Use, or that is otherwise
illegal. Government, in its sole and absolute discretion, may preserve content and may also disclose
content if required to do so by law or judicial or governmental mandate or as reasonably determined
useful by government to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of government’s websites’
users and the public or as permitted by law.</p>

<h2>Indemnification</h2>

<p>You agree to indemnify government and its employees, agents, representatives and third party service
providers, and to defend and hold each of them harmless, from any and all claims and liabilities
(including legal fees) which may arise from your submissions, from your unauthorized use of material
obtained through the website, or from your breach of this Terms of Use, or from any other acts through
your use of the website.</p>

<h2>Editing and deletions</h2>

<p>Government reserves the right, but undertakes no duty, to review, edit, move or delete any material
provided for display or placed on the website or its forums, blogs, wikis, chats, etc., or otherwise, in its
sole discretion, without notice.</p>

<h2>External websites</h2>

<p>Government's websites may link you to websites outside of our control. These links are solely for your
convenience and information and do not constitute an endorsement of those websites, their contents,
or the services provided on those sites. Government is not responsible for the accuracy, currency, or the
reliability of the content.</p>

<p>Our privacy policy applies only when you are on Government of Nova Scotia websites. Once you go to
another website, take care to read that website’s privacy policy before disclosing any personal
information. The personal information you provide on these links may be stored outside of Canada. The
subsequent use and disclosure of your personal information would not be subject to the protections or
provisions of Nova Scotia privacy laws.</p>
