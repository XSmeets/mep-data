Target may update the Target Circle Terms or make any changes to the Target App or to the Site at any time without notice. You agree to any updates to the Target Circle Terms by continuing to participate in the program. </p><p>In the Target Circle Terms, these words are defined as follows: </p><p><b>Target Circle</b> is a loyalty program offered by Target Corporation. </p><p><b>Target Circle Terms</b> are these terms that govern the Target Circle program. </p><p><b>Target Circle Deals</b> are Target Circle-specific discounts and promotions that will apply automatically to your purchase when you identify as a Target Circle member at checkout. </p><p><b>Target Circle Rewards</b> are rewards which can be earned by Target Circle members. </p><p><b>Target Circle Bonus</b> is a personalized offer that you may get while being a member of Target Circle either to receive additional savings or promotional items or to earn Target Circle Rewards.  </p><p><b>Target Circle Card</b> (formerly RedCard) means Target Debit Card, Target Credit Card, Target™ Mastercard<sup style="font-size: .6em;">®</sup>, and Target Circle Card Account (Target Circle Card Reloadable Account). </p><p><b>Community Giving Program</b> is the program which provides Target Circle members the opportunity to earn and cast votes to help direct where Target makes its Donation to Nonprofits. </p><p><b>Nonprofits</b> are the nonprofit organizations selected by Target for the Community Giving Program. </p><p><b>Donation</b> is the charitable donation Target makes to Nonprofits in the Community Giving Program. </p><p><b>Voting Period</b> is the time period during which Target Circle members can cast votes for Nonprofits in the Community Giving Program. </p><p>Receiving Target Circle Benefits </p><p>When you are a Target Circle member, in order to receive, earn and redeem the Target Circle benefits, you need to provide your first and last name and a valid email address in your Target account. In order to receive birthday rewards, you also need to provide your birthday (month and day) in your Target Circle account. </p><p>To earn Target Circle Rewards and Community Giving Program votes, you must identify yourself as a Target Circle member when you make a purchase at Target. When you make a purchase in Target stores, you can identify yourself as a Target Circle member at checkout by entering your mobile telephone number (provided that you have already enrolled as a member by providing your first and last name and a valid email address, as stated above, and have provided a valid U.S. mobile telephone number in your Target Circle account), by scanning the Wallet barcode in the Target App, or by paying with the Target Circle Card connected to your Target Circle account. As of January 18, 2023, Target Circle Cards can no longer be connected to a Target Circle account. If you connected your Target Circle Card to your Target Circle account prior to January 18, 2023, you can continue to use that Target Circle Card to identify yourself as Target Circle member as long as you do not change the Target Circle Card number connected to your Target Circle account.

A qualifying purchase excludes all items that do not earn Target Circle Rewards, as listed elsewhere in these Target Circle Terms.  </p><p>A pre-ordered item is eligible for a Target Circle Bonus only if it is shipped during the stated Target Circle Bonus period. Online, Same Day Delivery, Order Pickup and Drive Up purchases are eligible when the order is placed within the Target Circle Bonus period, but credit for the purchase isn’t received until the items ship or are ready for pickup, respectively. If qualifying purchases are returned, reversed or canceled, this may cause the transaction to no longer qualify for a Target Circle Bonus, which will be determined by Target in its sole discretion. </p><p>For any Target Circle Bonus with minimum purchase thresholds, the amount is calculated before other discounts (other than Target Circle Deals and sale prices) and taxes are applied. Your purchase subtotal should be more than the required purchase threshold to qualify.   </p><p>Except for online orders that include Target Plus™ items or use the Same Day Delivery service, an online order qualifies as one purchase transaction even if items in the order are delivered separately or you use the Order Pickup or Drive Up service for some or all of the items in the online order. Online orders can include both Target Plus items and Target.com items. For purposes of a Target Circle Bonus, the Target Plus items and the Target.com items are separate purchase transactions and each purchase transaction is eligible to be a qualifying purchase. If you use the Same Day Delivery service, the Same Day Delivery items are a separate purchase transaction from any other items in the online order, and each purchase transaction is eligible to be a qualifying purchase.   </p><p>Please allow 24 hours for your Target Circle Bonus to advance after in-store purchases. For online or Target App purchases, you will see your Target Circle Bonus advance once your order ships, is picked up or is delivered by a shopper if you use the Same Day Delivery service. Non-transaction Target Circle Bonus progress will reflect within 24 hours from the completion of the qualifying action.  </p><p>For any Target Circle Bonus that awards Target Circle Rewards, Target reserves the right to deduct any Target Circle Rewards earned from a Target Circle Bonus from your Target Circle account if you no longer qualify for the Target Circle Bonus due to the return, reversal or cancelation of qualifying purchases or are no longer deemed to have completed the qualifying action. </p><p>Target Circle Bonuses are valid only for the fully enrolled Target Circle member who received the bonus and cannot be shared, copied or transferred. Limit one Target Circle Reward per Target Circle member per Target Circle Bonus. Not all Target Circle members receive Target Circle Bonuses and Target Circle Bonuses may vary. You must be a member of Target Circle at the time you make qualifying purchases or complete qualifying actions, respectively, and at the time the Target Circle Rewards are added to your Target Circle account. All other Target Circle Terms remain in effect, including the circumstances in which Target Circle Rewards expire. </p><p>Target Circle Rewards </p><p>As a member of Target Circle, you are eligible to earn Target Circle Rewards. </p><p>Target Circle Rewards can only be redeemed for certain merchandise or services at Target.

Once your Target account profile is complete, you can redeem Target Circle Rewards. To redeem on your next purchase in Target stores, elect to apply the Target Circle Rewards in your Target Circle account, and then either provide your mobile telephone number (if you provided your mobile telephone number) or scan your Wallet in the Target App during checkout.

You cannot elect to apply only a portion of your Target Circle Rewards to a purchase. If your purchase is less than the amount of the Target Circle Rewards you have applied, the remaining amount may be unavailable for a second transaction until the first transaction has completed processing. </p><p>Target Circle Rewards are applied to the total purchase amount after all other discounts have been applied to the purchase transaction, except that if you use your Target Circle Card to pay for the purchase, any applicable Target Circle Card 5% discount will be applied to the transaction after the Target Circle Rewards are redeemed. </p><p>Target Circle Rewards cannot be redeemed for the following: </p><ul><li>adult beverage purchases; </li><li>dairy product purchases; </li><li>purchases of prescriptions and over-the-counter items located behind the pharmacy counter; </li><li>purchases made at some partner businesses, including in-store clinics, Target Optical and Target Plus Partners; </li><li>Same Day Delivery purchases, purchases made on the Shipt app and tips for shoppers; </li><li>purchases made from Target through third-party sites such as Google Express; </li><li>purchases of Target GiftCards;  </li><li>purchases of specialty gift cards and Visa, American Express and Mastercard gift cards/prepaid cards; </li><li>purchases fulfilled via email (for example, video game digital downloads and digital specialty gift cards); </li><li>taxes, bottle deposits, shipping, delivery, handling and all other fees or charges; </li><li>payment of any Target Circle Card balance, debit card cash withdrawals at checkout and payments for insufficient funds; </li><li>prior purchases; or </li><li>where otherwise prohibited by law. </li></ul><p></p><p>Other restrictions may apply to redeeming Target Circle Rewards. </p><p>If you return an item that was part of a purchase in which you redeemed Target Circle Rewards, the amount of your redeemed Target Circle Rewards will be credited to your Target Circle Rewards balance (up to the value of the returned item), and any remaining refund amount will be refunded according to <a href="https://www.target.com/returns#?lnk=snav_rd_return_policy">Target’s return policy</a>. If items that earned Target Circle Rewards are returned, the associated Target Circle Rewards may be removed from your Target Circle Rewards balance. Target reserves the right to take your Target Circle Rewards to a negative balance (i.e., a balance in your account of less than zero Target Circle Rewards). In such event you will not have redeemable Target Circle Rewards until the balance of Target Circle Rewards in your account is greater than zero. </p><p>Beginning April 7, 2024, Target Circle members will no longer earn Target Circle Earnings rewards (the former name of Target Circle Rewards) at a rate of 1% of the eligible purchase amount every time a member uses a non-Target Circle Card form of payment. Any previously earned Target Circle Earnings rewards will roll over as Target Circle Rewards on the same terms and conditions as existed at the time they were received, subject to all other requirements set forth in these Target Circle Terms.  </p><p>For Target Circle members who had a 1% Target Circle Earnings rewards balance as of September 4, 2019, the unspent earnings were transferred to an eGiftCard which can be found in your Target account or in the Wallet in the Target App. The eGiftCard does not expire and can be redeemed for merchandise or services other than gift cards and prepaid cards at Target stores or on Target.com but cannot be redeemed for cash or credit except where required by law. View the eGiftCard for terms and conditions. </p><p>Target Circle Digital Manufacturer Coupons </p><p>Manufacturer coupons are digital manufacturer coupons available through Target Circle. Each coupon is valid for a single use per Target Circle account, and savings do not stack with paper manufacturer coupons. The terms and conditions applicable to each coupon will vary and will be stated at the time of adding the coupon to your Target Circle Deals page. </p><p>To access any available coupons, you must sign in to your Target Circle account and activate the coupons that you want to use on your Target Circle Deals page; coupons are not applied at checkout unless you choose to apply it to the specific transaction.  </p><p>Only those Target Circle coupons that are activated on your Target Circle Deals page at the time of purchase can be redeemed.

Photographs of barcodes will not be accepted. You may also redeem coupons using the valid telephone number you provided for your Target account. </p><p>Target has the right to remove or cancel coupons from Target Circle, and from your Target Circle Deals page, at any time and for any reason without notice. </p><p>For coupons with a percentage discount, the actual savings may vary based on the item price at each store. </p><p>The numbers shown for total savings at the individual and global level for Target Circle coupons are specific to each account and do not reflect combined totals or the impact of any returns or exchanges that may be associated with those transactions. </p><p>All Target Circle coupons are subject to local and state laws and regulations.

Birthday rewards given will vary and are limited to one award per year per Target Circle account. </p><p>Community Giving Program </p><p>Target may run multiple local Community Giving Programs. By participating in Target Circle you have access to one Community Giving Program associated with your preferred store location as designated in your Target account settings. In each Community Giving Program, Target will make a Donation to be allocated among Nonprofits. Eligibility of the Nonprofits will be determined by Target in its sole discretion. Multiple store locations may be tied to a single Community Giving Program. The Nonprofits, Donation amount and Voting Period may vary by Community Giving Program. The allocation of the Donation among the Nonprofits for each Community Giving Program will be based on the percentage of votes each Nonprofit receives during the applicable Voting Period for that Community Giving Program. With respect to each Community Giving Program, the list of participating Nonprofits, the dates comprising the applicable Voting Period, and the Donation to be divided among the Nonprofits can be seen by logging on to and viewing the Target Circle voting screen on the Target App or at Target.com/circle. </p><p>As a member of Target Circle, every time you make an eligible purchase and identify yourself as a Target Circle member, you earn one vote. Only purchases made at Target stores or online at Target.com or in the Target App are eligible to earn Community Giving Program votes. </p><p>Votes are not earned on a purchase transaction that is comprised only of one or more of the following: adult beverage purchases; purchases of prescriptions and over-the-counter items located behind the pharmacy counter; purchases made at some partner businesses, including in-store clinics, and Target Optical; purchases made on the Shipt App and tips for shoppers; purchases made from Target through third-party sites such as Google Express; purchases of Target GiftCards; purchases of Visa, American Express and Mastercard gift cards/prepaid cards; taxes, shipping, delivery, handling and all other fees or charges; payment of any Target Circle Card balance, debit card cash withdrawals at checkout and payments for insufficient funds; prior purchases; or where otherwise prohibited by law. </p><p>To cast Community Giving Program votes, follow the instructions located under Target Circle benefits in your Target account via the Target App or Target.com/circle. You must have access to internet through your own device to participate. You must be a Target Circle member in good standing to participate. Votes have no cash value and do not represent an actual donation to any Nonprofit; rather, they are just the means to vote for allocation of the Donation from Target in each Community Giving Program. Target’s tally of votes is final. Each vote is intended for one-time use by you. If Target detects any inappropriate conduct related to votes or votes made outside the above guidelines, votes may be disregarded. In the event any aspect of Target Circle, including the voting, is disrupted in any way, Target reserves the right to allocate the Donation for any affected location in a fair and equitable manner, as determined by Target. </p><p>From time to time, Target may provide the opportunity to cast Community Giving Program votes to direct additional or supplemental Donations. These opportunities may have terms and conditions in addition to or different from those provided in the Target Circle Terms. Unless otherwise stated, the Target Circle Terms will apply to any such opportunity. </p></span></dd></dl><dl class="h-text-md"><dt><a name="target360"></a>Target Circle 360™ Membership</dt><dd><span><p>Target Circle 360 is a subscription program that offers the benefits described in these Target Circle 360 Terms in addition to additional offers, deals and benefits to be determined by Target in its sole discretion.

When a clear and valid notice is received pursuant to the guidelines set forth below, Target will respond by either taking down the allegedly infringing content or blocking access to it. Target may contact the notice provider to request additional information.

You and Target may not be plaintiffs or class members in any purported class, collective, or representative proceeding, and may each bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity.

The Notice must describe the nature and basis of the claim and the specific relief sought. If the parties cannot reach an agreement within 30 days from the receipt of the Notice, either party may initiate arbitration proceedings.</p><p>A form to initiate arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA site at <a href="http://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a>.
