<p style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><b>General</b></p>
<p style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">We believe that arbitration offers a prompt and efficient way to resolve any dispute, controversy or other claim between us (whether arising under any legal or equitable theory, and given the broadest meaning enforceable under law, a “Dispute”).&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">To the maximum extent permitted by law, you and we agree that any and all Disputes will be resolved exclusively and finally using binding arbitration and will only be conducted on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, representative or similar action, except as provided below.&nbsp; There is no judge or jury in arbitration, the discovery and other procedures are more limited and less formal, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.&nbsp; The arbitrator must follow these Terms of Use and can award the same damages and relief as a court in an individual proceeding (including attorney’s fees).&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Acceptance of these Terms of Use constitutes a waiver of your right to litigate the Dispute in any court, the opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury, and the ability to proceed in a class, consolidated, representative or similar action, except as provided below.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><b>Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution</b></p>
<p style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Before you can commence any proceeding as to a Dispute, you must first give us an opportunity to resolve the Dispute by emailing us at GEC@LULULEMON.COM a notification that contains the following information: (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) a written description of your claim in the Dispute, and (4) a description of the specific relief you seek.&nbsp; If we do not resolve the Dispute within 45 days after receiving your notification, then you may pursue the Dispute in arbitration or, if you have opted out of arbitration as provided under “Right to Opt Out, in court.</p>
<p style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><b>Right to Opt Out</b></p>
<p style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Notwithstanding the above, you may choose to pursue a Dispute in court and not by arbitration if you opt out of arbitration within 30 days from the date that you first consent to these Terms of Use (the “Opt-Out Deadline”).&nbsp; To opt out of arbitration, simply email us at GEC@LULULEMON.COM the following information: (1) your name; (2) your address; and (3) a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve Disputes with us through arbitration. Please be assured that any decision to opt out of arbitration will have no adverse effect on your relationship with us.&nbsp; But, we do have to enforce the Opt-Out Deadline so keep in mind that <b>any opt out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and you will be required to pursue any Dispute in arbitration</b>.</p>
<p style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><b>Arbitration Procedures</b></p>
<p style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">If the Dispute is not resolved as provided under Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution, either you or we may initiate arbitration proceedings.&nbsp; The American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), www.adr.org, will arbitrate all disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator.&nbsp; All issues shall be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of the arbitration provisions in these Terms of Use.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.&nbsp; These Terms of Use govern in the event of any conflict with the applicable arbitration rules.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Under no circumstances will class action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration, and the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s Disputes or otherwise preside over any form of a class, consolidated, representative or similar action, unless both you and we specifically agree following initiation of the arbitration.&nbsp; The arbitration will be conducted in English, closed to the public and confidential.&nbsp; All related records shall be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award.</p>
<p style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The U.S. Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) may govern the arbitrability of Disputes.&nbsp; However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or conditions precedent to suit.</p>
<p style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Nothing herein will preclude us from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration (such as orders to stay a court action or compel arbitration), temporary restraining orders or similar relief, or redress for potential violations of our intellectual property rights, from any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><b>Arbitration Award</b></p>
<p style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding.&nbsp; The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party.&nbsp; Such award will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.</p>
<p style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><b>Location of Arbitration</b></p>
<p style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Unless we mutually agree on a different location, arbitration shall occur in Seattle, Washington.&nbsp; You waive any right to claim that such location is an inconvenient forum, and you agree not to sue us or bring arbitration in any other forum.</p>
<p style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">To minimize the costs and burdens of associated with arbitration, you and we agree that the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner to be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration.&nbsp; You and we further agree that the arbitration will not require any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by the parties.</p>
