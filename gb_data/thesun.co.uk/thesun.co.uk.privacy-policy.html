<p><span style="font-weight: 400">User interactions with polls that touch on topics that we consider more sensitive or emotive, like those involving topics relating to wars or conflicts, crime and wrongdoing, gender based issues etc., may be associated with individual users, but will only be used at an aggregate level for editorial and commercial insights and analysis. User engagement with these types of polls will not be used to profile individual customers for marketing or advertising purposes. </span></p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Undertake a data protection impact assessment, where legally required&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Put in place appropriate controls to ensure that data protection risks are mitigated to an acceptable level</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Follow a Privacy by Design approach when developing the chatbot</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Where our chatbots leverage third party generative AI platforms, the information you disclose via the chatbot may be shared with the provider of the AI platform for its purposes, over which we have no control.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Please do not submit any information with our chatbots that you would not be willing to share publicly. </span></p>
<h3>OTHER SOURCES</h3>
<p>We may ask data management and consumer insight providers if they have lifestyle, demographic, household information or other insights about you. This information helps us better understand our audiences. For more information on how to control this use of your information, see the section below on Controlling Your Information.</p>
<p>When you use third party payment providers, such as PayPal, to pay for or receive payment from us, we will receive information including your name, email address, billing or other address, phone number (if applicable), date of sign-up, the number of payments you have received from verified PayPal users, whether you have been verified to have control of a bank account and any other information you agree they can share. If you apply for credit, we may also receive information from credit reference agencies.</p>
<p>Other organisations that provide products and services to you may also share information with us. For example, they may notify us when you move home or when the payment card you used with us is renewed or replaced, so that we can keep your information accurate and up to date. This also helps ensure that you do not lose access to our products and services. We also may receive information from our partners about their customer database. This allows our partners to see if they can reach their audiences on our platforms. Generally we will receive aggregated information rather than individual information, although your information may be used to generate these insights.</p>

<p>There may be some uses of your information where we need to ask for your consent. You will have the right to withdraw that consent at any time, however, if you withdraw consent, we may not be able to provide the product or service you have requested. We will rely on your consent to:</p>
<p><strong>Deliver Direct Marketing Communications:</strong> where required, we will ask your permission if we want to deliver direct marketing to you. If you have an account connected to one of our products, you may be able to change your marketing preferences in a preference centre linked to that account. You will also be able to opt out in the communication itself.</p>
<p>We may send you direct marketing communications via post, telephone, email, SMS, social media, online, in-app and devices connected to the internet, like smart TVs, if we hold a valid direct marketing permission for you where required.</p>
<p><strong>Place cookies and similar technologies:</strong> in accordance with the information provided in the “Cookies &amp; Similar Technologies” section and the information provided to you when those technologies are used.</p>
<h3>FULFILLING A CONTRACT</h3>
<p>We process your personal information to fulfil a contract we have with you. We rely on this legal basis to:</p>
<p><strong>Provide products and services you have asked for and manage our relationship with you:</strong> This may include managing requests, payments, access to products and services, allowing you to interact, comment, and participate in online games, contests, live and recorded events and reward programmes. This may also include sending you information and updates relating to the products and services we provide to you.</p>
<p><strong>Take payments, check your identity and conduct credit checks:</strong> Information that we hold about you and that you provide to us may be used to take payment for products and services. It may also be used to verify credit details related to payments. Payment details may be retained in order to speed up the renewal process for products and services.</p>
<p>If you apply for credit, then in order to help us make credit decisions about you we may check with credit reference agencies who will record any credit searches on your credit file. We may also disclose details of how you conduct your account with us to these credit reference agencies for related purposes.</p>
<h3>FOR A LEGITIMATE INTEREST</h3>
<p>We may use your information where there is a legitimate reason to do so, such as where it would help achieve our business objectives or to facilitate a benefit to you or someone else.</p>
<p>Our legitimate interests in processing personal data include:</p>
<ul>
<li>to support a free press, including journalistic activities of societal importance;</li>
<li>to support individual and societal rights to receive information;</li>
<li>to develop, deliver and maintain relevant and engaging products services and advertising;</li>
<li>understanding when our audiences engage with us or other organisations;</li>
<li>to build a clearer understanding of who our audiences are in order to better serve them;</li>
<li>to carry on the business of a commercial organisation; and</li>
<li>to demonstrate that we provide services and products to agreed industry standards.</li>
</ul>
<p>We rely on these legitimate interests to:</p>
<p><strong>Monitor, improve and protect our products, content, services and websites, online and offline:</strong> This includes using information about your app download to validate free trials.</p>
<p><strong>Manage complaints:</strong> including requests and concerns that you may have about products or services we provide.</p>
<p><strong>Personalise your experience:</strong> We sometimes make assumptions about your interests and preferences based on the way you interact with our products and services and the information we hold about you.</p>
<p>Knowing these interests and preferences allows us to understand the products, content and services our customers like, letting us focus our efforts on developing those areas. We may use this information to tailor and personalise your user experience, as well as to make decisions about what direct marketing and advertising to show you.</p>
<p><strong>Content recommendations:</strong> We may also use your information to optimise article and content recommendations. Based on the kind of articles and content which prove to be of interest to you.</p>
<p><strong>To build and manage direct marketing campaigns:</strong> We use your information to create engaging and relevant marketing campaigns promoting products and services we think you will like from our brands and partners. The use of your information to do this is usually based on a legitimate interest, however, we will ask your permission if we want to deliver direct marketing to you. You will be able to change your marketing preferences in your Preference Centre or in the communications you are sent.</p>
<p><strong>To send product related and similar product and services communications:</strong> for certain types of marketing communications, we do not require your consent and we instead rely on our legitimate interest. This is the case for example where we send you postal advertising or where we send you ‘in-life’ communications about products or services that we provide to you. You can opt out of these communications either by visiting your preference centre if you have an account or in the communication itself.</p>
<p>We may send you service-related messages, which are about the service we provide. We do not require your consent for these, and you are not able to opt out.</p>
<p><strong>Prevent fraud, check your identity, and prevent money laundering:</strong> We may use your information to check your identity in relation to requests you make. We may also have a legal obligation requiring us to carry out this activity</p>
<p><strong>Facilitate posting, commenting and interaction:</strong> If you correspond with any of our titles, radio stations or TV channels, or interact with other customers or audience members or our staff, for example by using polls, comments, text messages, video, email, phone, radio or by post, we may display this content indefinitely in any relevant context, subject to our editorial judgement and your rights as set out in this Policy. This may be anonymised in the case of testimonials or customer service conversations. If you take part in any reader or listener forums, send us letters for publication, or take part in any radio ‘phone-ins’, then you may be identifiable to others publicly and your comments attributed to you.</p>
<p><strong>Deliver relevant advertising:</strong> We may use the information we hold about you to help us and our partners make better decisions about what adverts to present to you. We also use the information we collect from you and other sources to create engaging and relevant marketing campaigns promoting products and services we think you will like from our brands and partners.</p>
<p>When you visit our websites, use our apps, or watch content on devices connected to the internet such as smart TVs, advertising networks and other intermediaries that we work with may select and then display adverts on your device. In the case of some of our digital radio stations, when listening online, we and our partners may insert a relevant audio advert for you to listen to.</p>
<p><strong>Audience segmentation and creation:</strong> we may use the information we hold about you, including how you engage with our products and services, as well as from other sources, to segment our audiences into groups with particular attributes (likes/dislikes/reading behaviours etc). This helps us personalise your experience and show you more relevant content and adverts.</p>
<p><strong>Cookie matching/syncing:</strong> When you visit our sites, we may check your device to see if a cookie ID has been assigned to it. This is a form of identifier that tells us who is visiting our sites. We are then able to compare the cookie ID we have for you with IDs that our advertisers hold to see if we both know who you are. By knowing it is you (or your device), the advertiser can decide if they want to advertise to you and if so, what advertising would be relevant. See the section on Cookies &amp; Similar Technologies for more information.</p>
<p><strong>Data matching:</strong> From time to time we may allow our clients to compare their customer database to ours. This is called data matching and allows our partners to see if they can reach their audiences on our platforms. Generally this will be conducted at an aggregate audience level to provide insights, rather than individual level information, although your information may be used to generate these insights. These insights might include the overlap between our audiences and the client and other information that would be useful to understand if an advertising campaign would be effective.</p>
<p>As part of the data matching process we may allow partners to build target audiences based on pre-defined attributes. These ‘lookalike’ audiences may be similar to our partners’ existing audiences. For example, a sports brand may want to reach ‘sports enthusiasts’ or those who enjoy ‘outdoor pursuits’. They could select audiences who have been identified as having an interest in these areas. To do this, we segment our audiences into groups depending on what we think they like or other behaviours. This helps them find the right audiences and we are able to show you more relevant advertising.</p>
<p><strong>Detect ad blockers:</strong> We may collect information from your devices that tells us whether you are using an ad blocker. This is so that we can manage our compliance with the law and also determine if we are able to show you advertising. We may also ask you to suspend or whitelist our sites or platforms so that we can show you adverts. As a predominantly advertising funded business, we do rely on our ability to show you advertising to help ensure we are able to provide you with the products and services you request.</p>
<p><strong>Provide co-branded services, events and features:</strong> We may offer co-branded services or features, such as competitions or other promotions, together with a third party and may share the information you provide to us with that third party. These co-branded services may be hosted by us or by the third party. It will usually be obvious where this is the case and will provide you with additional information where required. Please remember that where we share your information with these third parties, that they will use your information in accordance with their privacy policy.</p>
<p><strong>Ensure our services are used appropriately:</strong> If you post or send offensive or objectionable content anywhere on or to our websites or apps, or otherwise engage in any disruptive behaviour on any of our platforms, we may use the information that is available to us about you to stop such behaviour. This may involve informing relevant third parties, including your employer, law enforcement or other competent authorities about the content and your behaviour.</p>
<p><strong>Ensure that our products and services conform to agreed industry standards:</strong> Some of our products and services are independently monitored and assessed to ensure they meet approved industry standards and for industry reporting purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Provide you with support:</strong> We may also provide you with help and support where we believe it is required. For example, if you have provided your contact information, we may contact you when a checkout journey is not completed. We may record phone calls or customer enquiries via online chat for quality, training and management purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Conduct market research and analytics:</strong> We may use the information we hold on you about your engagement with our products and services, as well as other information collected from partners and other sources, to understand how our products are used and make improvements or develop other products and services our audiences may like. We may need to contact you about your experience of a product or service we provide you.</p>
<p><strong>Ipsos Iris – market research project:</strong> When you visit our website, we may collect certain personal data about you for an online audience measurement project that analyses internet users’ behaviour and profile across different websites, applications and devices in the UK. Ipsos MORI, a specialist research agency will be carrying out this research, in conjunction with UKOM, the UK Online Measurement company and DotMetrics. To contact Ipsos MORI about this specific research, please email: <a href="mailto:compliance@ipsosiris.com">compliance@ipsosiris.com</a></p>
<p><strong>Change of control or sale of our business:</strong> We may transfer, sell or assign any of the information described in this Policy to third parties as a result of a sale, merger, consolidation, change of control, transfer of assets or reorganisation of our business.</p>
<h3>TO COMPLY WITH LEGAL OBLIGATIONS &amp; PROTECT OUR RIGHTS</h3>
<p>There may be situations where we need to use your information to comply with legal and regulatory obligations or defend claims. This may include publishing information about prize winners, for example.</p>
<p>We may also disclose your information where we are allowed to by law to protect or enforce our rights or the rights of others and for the prevention and detection of crime, such as fraud.</p>
<h3>OTHER CONSIDERATIONS</h3>
<p>The specific legal basis we use will depend on the activity the information is used for. Please keep in mind that while we will rely on one legal basis, if that is no longer available to us, we may be able to rely on another.</p>

<p><strong>Experian</strong><br>
We use Experian to make the content and advertising shown on devices that you might use or that may relate to the same household more relevant and useful. Experian may also provide insight reporting as part of their service.</p>
<p>As part of this process Experian uses cookies and may receive information about the kind of device you use as well as your IP address, location data, device user agent string or information about websites where your device has previously displayed advertising. By using our sites, you acknowledge that Experian will process personal data about you for the above purpose and for the profiling of audiences bearing similarities to your data on the basis of our or their legitimate interests.</p>
<p>You have a choice about whether or not you want your information to be used in this way. Please see the section below on Controlling your Information. This will not stop you from seeing content about our products and services when you visit our websites, but it will mean that the content you do see may not be as relevant to you.</p>
<h3>CONTROL OVER DATA MATCHING</h3>

<h3>OTHER RIGHTS</h3>
<p>You have the right to ask us for a copy of your personal data; to correct, delete or restrict (stop any active) processing of your personal data; and to obtain the personal data you provide to us for a contract or with your consent in a structured, machine readable format, and to ask us to share (port) this data to another controller. In addition, you can object to the processing of your personal data in some circumstances (in particular, where we don’t have to process the data to meet a contractual or other legal requirement, or where we are using the data for direct marketing).</p>
<p>To exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the contact details below. These rights may be restricted by law, for example we may not be able to provide a copy of your data where the data we hold is also the data of a third party and it is not reasonable to disclose this information.</p>
<p>If you have unresolved concerns and you live in the EU/EEA, you have the right to complain to a data protection authority where you live, work or where you believe a breach may have occurred. In the UK, you also have this right and you may contact the Information Commissioner’s Office.</p>

<h3>HOW TO EXERCISE YOUR ACCESS, CORRECTION, PORTABILITY AND DELETION RIGHTS</h3>
<p>California residents may exercise their California privacy rights by submitting a request via our online <a href="https://privacyportal-cdn.onetrust.com/dsarwebform/8930e991-baac-4a05-89f0-fc400879fa8a/8c7dac12-a6f8-4e1e-90ce-cabc3d6767e9.html">portal</a> or by sending an email to <a href="mailto:dataprotection@news.co.uk">dataprotection@news.co.uk</a> with ‘CCPA’ or ‘CPRA’ in the subject line. For security purposes, we will verify your identity – in part by asking you to verify your email address and requesting certain information from you, when you request to exercise your California privacy rights, such as address and photographic ID.</p>
<p>To request that we provide you with the specific pieces of personal information we have from you or to delete personal information we have collected from you, we may also need to ask you for additional information to verify your identity.</p>
<p>Once we have verified your identity (and your agent, as applicable), we will comply with your request, unless an exemption applies.</p>
<p>Where you have requested the categories of information that we have collected about you, or specific pieces of personal information, we will provide the information you have requested, except where not permitted under applicable law or otherwise exempted by the CPRA. For instance, we may not disclose financial account numbers as such disclosure may create an unreasonable risk to your personal information, your account with us, or our business systems.</p>
<p>Where you have requested that we delete personal information that we have collected from you, we will inform you whether or not we were able to comply with your request. Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law.</p>
<p>If we are unable to complete your requests fully for any of the reasons above, we will provide you with additional information about the reasons that we could not comply with your request.</p>
<h3>AUTHORISED AGENTS</h3>
<p>You may designate an agent to make requests to exercise your rights under CPRA as described above. We will take steps to verify the identity of the person seeking to exercise their rights as listed above, and to verify that your agent has been authorised to make a request on your behalf through providing us with a signed written authorisation or a copy of a power of attorney.</p>

<p>Cookies and other online tracking technologies are small bits of data or code that are used to identify your devices when you use and interact with our websites, apps and other services. They are often used for remembering your preferences, to identify relevant content for you, to remember you’re logged in and allowing you to interact with our products and services.</p>
<h3>WHAT OTHER TECHNOLOGIES DO WE USE</h3>
<p>As well as cookies, we use other types of tracking technologies:</p>
<h4>Web Beacons and Tracking Pixels</h4>
<p>These are bits of data that count the number of users who access a website or page and can also allow us to see if a cookie has been activated. Web beacons used on pages or in emails allow us to see how successful an article has been, or whether an email message was successfully delivered and read in a marketing campaign. Web beacons are also used to verify any clicks through to links or advertisements contained in emails. We may use this information to help us identify which emails are more interesting to you and to inform advertisers how many customers have clicked on their adverts (the information shared with advertisers is aggregated and does not identify you individually).</p>
<h4>Flash Cookies</h4>
<p>We may, in certain situations, use Adobe Flash Player to deliver special content, such as video clips or animation. To improve your user experience, Local Shared Objects (commonly known as Flash cookies) are used to provide functions such as remembering your settings and preferences. Flash cookies are stored on your device, but they are managed through an interface different from the one provided by your web browser.</p>
<h4>Tracking URLs</h4>
<p>Tracking URLs are a special web link that allows us to measure when a link is clicked on. They are used to help us measure the effectiveness of campaigns and advertising and the popularity of articles that are read or programmes that are viewed.</p>
<h4>Device Fingerprinting</h4>
<p>We may collect and analyse a device’s browser information to help identify that device, present content correctly, conduct analytics and help prevent and detect fraud.</p>
<h4>Authenticated Consent</h4>
<p>Authenticated consent is a mechanism which <strong><span style="font-weight: 400">enables consent for the collection and use of personal data to be shared between relevant controllers.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">News Broadcasting uses authenticated consent on its sites for this purpose.</span></p>
<h4>If you Access our Services from a Mobile Device</h4>
<p>We may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, geo-location data, and other transactional information for that device. We may also use the unique identifier to validate free trials, for example.</p>
<h3>WHAT CATEGORIES OF COOKIES DO WE USE AND WHY?</h3>
<h4>Essential Cookies and Similar Technologies</h4>
<p>These are vital for the running of our services on our websites and apps. Without the use of these cookies, parts of our websites would not function. For example, we use these cookies to:</p>
<ul>
<li>help us identify which of our readers, listeners or viewers have a subscription in order to access content they are entitled to on the website or app</li>
<li>tell if you are logged in to your account, which allows extra functionality, such as commenting on stories</li>
<li>identify and prevent threats to our sites or apps</li>
<li>protect your information and our business from outside threats</li>
<li>allow you to connect to our websites or apps</li>
<li>allow you to select and purchase products and services on our websites or apps</li>
<li>measure audiences across our websites or apps for industry reporting purposes</li>
</ul>
<h4>Analytics Cookies and Similar Technologies</h4>
<p>These collect information about your use of our websites and apps, and enable us to improve the way they work. For example, analytics cookies show us which are the most frequently visited pages on The Sun or The Times websites allowing us to display the most popular articles more prominently. They help us record how you interact with our websites or apps, such as how you navigate around pages and from page to page, identifying improvements we can make to the customer journey. They also help identify any difficulties you have accessing our services, so we can fix any problems. Additionally, these cookies allow us to see overall patterns of usage at an aggregated level. This means we can highlight content and articles that we believe will be of interest to you. We provide personalisation by using cookies, IP addresses, web beacons, URL tracking and mobile app settings.</p>
<p>We may place cookies and similar technologies on behalf of comScore who help us measure the size and quality of our audiences across platforms. You can learn more and control how comScore use your information <a href="http://www.scorecardresearch.com/preferences.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<h4>Functional/Preference Cookies and Similar Technologies</h4>
<p>These cookies collect information about your choices and preferences, and allow us to remember things like language, your username (so you can log in faster), text size, and location, so we can show you relevant content to where you are. They allow us to customise the services you have accessed. We also use these cookies to provide you with services such as video clips.</p>
<h4>Social media cookies</h4>
<p>These cookies are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or “like” button on our sites or apps, or when you engage with our content on or through a social site such as Facebook or Twitter. These cookies collect information about your social media interaction with our websites or apps, such as whether or not you have an account with the social media site and whether you are logged into it when you interact with content on our websites or apps. This information may be linked to targeting/advertising activities.</p>
<h4>Tracking, Advertising Cookies and Similar Technologies</h4>
<p>We use these types of technologies to provide advertisements that we think may be more relevant to your interests. This can be done by delivering online adverts based on your previous browsing activity, known as “online behavioural advertising” (OBA). Cookies are placed on your device which will remember the websites you have visited or content you have viewed. Adverts based on what you have been looking at are then displayed to you when you visit websites or apps which use the same advertising networks.</p>
<p>These cookies may also be used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>track how many times adverts are seen by users;</li>
<li>determine if an advert lead to a click through to another website and lead to a sale or other action;</li>
<li>protect our advertisers’ brands; and</li>
<li>provide you with adverts based on your location, offers you click on, and other similar interactions with our websites and apps.</li>
</ul>
<h3>THIRD PARTY COOKIES</h3>
<p>We sell space on our websites and apps to advertisers. The adverts they display on our websites or apps will often contain cookies. Our advertisers may use cookies or similar technologies to provide you with advertisements that they believe are relevant. They may use browsing data obtained to restrict the number of times you see particular adverts (frequency capping). You may also see adverts from these advertisers on other websites you visit.</p>
<p>Third parties that support our services by serving advertisements or providing other services, such as allowing you to share content or tracking aggregate service usage, may also use cookies and other technologies to collect information relevant to the provision of those services.</p>
<p>We do not control third party cookies or other technologies. Their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies. You should make sure you are aware of how third parties will use cookies and whether your cookie data will be transferred to a third country by checking the third party’s cookie policy.</p>
<p>We do offer you the opportunity to control some third party cookies from partners we work with. A list of the third parties who place cookies on our websites can be found by accessing our consent management platform on our websites.</p>
<p>We work with Google Marketing Platform to help us deliver relevant advertising. To find out more about how this works visit: <a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/</a></p>
