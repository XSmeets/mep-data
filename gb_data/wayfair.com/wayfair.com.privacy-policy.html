For example, certain orders placed via mobile application while engaging with store-specific mobile application features are accepted, and payment is deemed received, at the participating store location, so that in some states the order will be deemed placed at the store location. As another example, orders placed on the Sites without using a store-specific mobile application, for shipment to destinations within the State of Illinois, are sold by Wayfair Illinois LLC, as indicated by your email order confirmation and invoice. Please consult a tax professional for more information regarding the applicable sales tax on your order. Your email order confirmation and invoice will identify the seller of record for your order and the applicable sales tax rate. Prices and availability of products on the Sites are subject to change without notice. Errors will be corrected when discovered and Wayfair reserves the right to revoke any stated offer and to correct any error, inaccuracy, or omission (including after an order has been submitted). Certain orders constitute improper use of the Sites and the Wayfair Rewards Program described below. Wayfair reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to refuse or cancel any order for any reason. Your account may also be restricted or terminated for any reason, at Wayfair's sole discretion. Items purchased pursuant to a quantity discount may be re-priced upon cancellation.  </span><span style="font-size: 10px;"><a href="#top" title="Back to Top"><u style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201);">Back to Top</u></a></span></div><h2><b style="font-size: 18px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">About Our Prices</b></h2><div class="bodytext" style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Where a product listing on our Sites references a higher price, typically denoted by a strikethrough (e.g. "<s>$549</s>"), such higher price represents the retail price suggested by the manufacturer or supplier. In the absence of a price suggested by the manufacturer or supplier, this price represents the highest price at which we offered or sold the product at some point in the past. For “Flash Deals”, where a product is temporarily being sold at a reduced price, an additional strikethrough price is presented that represents a recent previous price before the Flash Deal promotion. The "Sale" tag on a product listing on our Sites signifies that we are selling the product at a discount from a price in the previous 90 days. The Wayfair's Choice badge represents a shortlist of highly-rated, well-priced products we know customers love.</span></div><div class="bodytext" style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">When we use the term “Closeout,” we mean either that the product has been permanently reduced and will not return to the original price or that the product is temporarily being sold at a reduced price in order to clear an overstock of either Wayfair or supplier inventory. Prices of products listed on our Sites as “Closeout” may fluctuate during the “Closeout” promotion period for such products. For temporary “Closeout” pricing, such products may return to prices that are equal to or greater than their original prices upon expiration of the applicable “Closeout” promotion period.</span></div><div class="bodytext" style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">We do not price match.

Before formally pursuing a Covered Dispute in arbitration, you agree to first send a detailed notice (“Notice”) to Wayfair by email at <a href="mailto:legal@wayfair.com" target="_blank" title="Email Us"><u style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">legal@wayfair.com</u></a>. If Wayfair has a dispute with you, Wayfair agrees to first send a detailed Notice to your e-mail address on file with us. Your Notice must contain all of the following information: (1) your full name; (2) your address, telephone number, and email address; (3) information sufficient for Wayfair to identify any transaction at issue (e.g., your order number, order confirmation communication, etc.); and (4) a detailed description of your dispute, the nature and basis of your claim(s), and the nature and basis of the relief you are seeking with a calculation for it. You must personally sign this Notice. Wayfair’s Notice will likewise set forth (1) information sufficient for you to identify any transaction at issue and (2) a detailed description of our dispute, the nature and basis of our claim(s), and the nature and basis of the relief we are seeking with a calculation for it. You and Wayfair agree to negotiate in good faith about the dispute in an effort to swiftly resolve it to your satisfaction without the need for a formal proceeding. Should Wayfair request a telephone conference with you in an effort to resolve your dispute as part of this informal process, you agree to personally participate (with your counsel if you are represented). This process should result in resolution of the dispute, but if for some reason it is not resolved within 60 days after receipt of a fully completed Notice and the parties have not agreed to extend this time period, you or Wayfair may initiate an arbitration. Compliance with and completion of this mandatory informal dispute resolution process is a condition precedent to filing any demand for arbitration. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in this process. Unless prohibited by applicable law, the arbitration administrator shall not accept or administer any demand for arbitration unless the claimant has certified in writing that they have fully complied with this process. This certification shall be personally signed by you or Wayfair. A court shall have the authority to enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitrations without first providing a fully completed Notice and participating in good faith in this informal dispute resolution process.</span></div><h3><b style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px;">Initiating Arbitration and Arbitration Rules</b></h3><div class="bodytext" style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 14px;">Any arbitration between you and Wayfair shall be administered by National Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM”) in accordance with NAM’s operative Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (the “NAM Rules”) in effect at the time any demand for arbitration is filed with NAM, as modified by this Legal Disputes Section. For a copy of the NAM Rules, please visit https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms or contact NAM at NAM’s National Processing Center at 990 Stewart Avenue, 1st Floor, Garden City, NY 11530 and email address commercial@namadr.com. If NAM is unavailable or unwilling to administer the proceeding under the Legal Disputes Section as written, the parties agree that the arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) pursuant to the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules and the Consumer Due Process Protocol (collectively, "AAA Rules") in effect at the time any demand for arbitration is filed with AAA, as modified by this Legal Disputes Section. If the AAA is unavailable or unwilling to apply this Legal Disputes Section as written, the parties shall mutually agree on an alternative administrator that will administer the proceeding under the Legal Disputes Section as written. If the parties are unable to agree, they will petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint an arbitration administrator that will do so. Any arbitration will be held before a single neutral arbitrator.</span></div><div class="bodytext" style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 14px;">To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send the demand for arbitration or arbitration notice form made available from the arbitration administrator and supplement that form with a detailed description of your claim, including with the information required for your Notice and the accompanying signed certification of compliance with the informal process referenced above (collectively referred to as “demand for arbitration”), to NAM (or to AAA if it is the administrator as set forth above). You must personally sign your demand for arbitration. You agree to also send Wayfair a copy of your demand for arbitration at <a href="mailto:legal@wayfair.com" target="_blank" title="Email Us"><u style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">legal@wayfair.com.</u></a>. If Wayfair initiates arbitration, we will send a copy of our demand for arbitration to your email address on file with us.</span></div><div class="bodytext" style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 14px;">You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, virtually, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another location reasonably convenient for you, or at a mutually agreed-upon location. Wayfair reserves the right to request an in-person or videoconference hearing at any point within 14 days after its deadline to file any answer. After that time, Wayfair retains the right to request an in-person or virtual hearing from the arbitrator, which the arbitrator may elect to require along with your participation (with your counsel if you are represented). Should a hearing take place in person, it shall take place consistent with the geographic parameters set forth above.</span></div><h3><b style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px;">Arbitration Fees</b></h3><div class="bodytext" style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 14px;">Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the NAM Rules (or the AAA Rules should AAA be the designated administrator as set forth above). Upon a showing of financial hardship, Wayfair will consider your request to promptly reimburse your portion of the arbitration fees provided for in the NAM (or AAA) Rules.</span></div><h3><b style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px;">Arbitration Authority</b></h3><div class="bodytext" style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 14px;"><strong>The arbitrator has the sole authority to and shall address all claims or arguments by both parties concerning the formation, legality, and enforceability of this arbitration clause, the scope of this clause, and the arbitrability of any claim or issue arising between us.</strong></span></div><div class="bodytext" style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 14px;">There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. The arbitrator may not award relief for or against anyone who is not a party to the proceeding. The arbitrator is bound by and must follow the terms of these Terms of Use as a court would. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to address the essential findings and conclusions of law on which the award is based. The arbitration award shall be binding only between you and Wayfair and shall have no preclusive effect in any other arbitration or proceeding involving a different party, provided that the arbitrator may consider rulings in other arbitrations involving different individuals. The arbitrator may award fees and costs as provided by the NAM Rules (or the AAA Rules if AAA is the designated administrator as set forth above) or to the extent such fees and costs could be awarded in court or if the arbitrator determines that a claim, proceeding, or defense was frivolous or brought for harassment, for an improper purpose, or in bad faith. The arbitrator shall apply the provisions of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68 after entry of the award.</span></div><h3><b style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px;">Sole Exceptions to Arbitration</b></h3><div class="bodytext" style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 14px;">Notwithstanding the foregoing, in lieu of arbitration: (1) either you or Wayfair may elect to have an individual claim heard in small claims court consistent with any applicable jurisdictional and monetary limits that may apply, provided that it is brought and maintained as an individual claim and is not appealed or removed to any court of general jurisdiction; and (2) you agree that you or Wayfair may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.</span></div><h3><b style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px;">Jury Trial and Class Action Waiver</b></h3><div class="bodytext" style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 14px;"><strong>Except as the Terms of Use otherwise provide and to the fullest extent permitted by law, you and Wayfair acknowledge and agree that you are each waiving the right to a trial by jury and to the litigation of disputes in state or federal courts of general jurisdiction. The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action/class arbitration or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. You and Wayfair may not be plaintiffs or class members in any purported class, collective, private attorney general, or representative proceeding, or otherwise make or proceed with any claim on a collective or consolidated basis, and may each bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity. As referenced above, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only on an individual basis and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim. If a court determines that this class action waiver is not enforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief and all appeals from that decision have been exhausted (or the decision is otherwise final), then the parties agree that that particular claim or request for relief shall proceed in court but shall be stayed pending arbitration of the remaining claims.</strong></span></div><h3><b style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px;">Special Additional Procedures for Mass Arbitration</b></h3><div class="bodytext" style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 14px;">If 25 or more individuals seek to initiate arbitrations with Wayfair raising similar claims, and counsel for the individuals bringing the claims are the same or coordinated or the claims are otherwise coordinated (“Mass Claims”), you and Wayfair agree that these additional procedures shall apply, along with the applicable NAM Rules (or the applicable AAA Rules if AAA is the administrator as set forth above). You understand and agree that if you choose to initiate your claim as part of Mass Claims, the adjudication of your claim might be delayed. Counsel for the individuals and counsel for Wayfair shall each select 15 cases (per side) to be filed in and proceed in arbitration in bellwether proceedings to be resolved individually. Each case shall be assigned to a separate and different arbitrator. In the meantime, no other cases may be filed or deemed filed in arbitration, and the arbitration administrator shall not accept or administer arbitrations commenced in violation of these procedures. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining cases after the conclusion of the first stage of bellwether proceedings, each side may select another 15 cases (per side) to be filed in and proceed in arbitration in a second set of bellwether proceedings to be resolved individually. Each case shall be assigned to a separate and different arbitrator.

Wayfair reserves the right, without prior notification, to limit the order quantity on any item and/or to refuse service to any customer. Verification of information may be required prior to the acceptance of an order. However, by confirming your purchase at the end of the checkout process, you agree to accept and pay for the products as well as the shipping and handling charges and applicable taxes. The sales tax is based on the applicable state and local tax rates and laws, as well as the relevant circumstances such as the shipping, destination and/or service location of your order. For example, certain orders placed via mobile application while engaging with store-specific mobile application features are accepted, and payment is deemed received, at the participating store location, so that in some states the order will be deemed placed at the store location. As another example, orders placed on the Sites without using a store-specific mobile application, for shipment to destinations within the State of Illinois, are sold by Wayfair Illinois LLC, as indicated by your email order confirmation and invoice. Please consult a tax professional for more information regarding the applicable sales tax on your order. Your email order confirmation and invoice will identify the seller of record for your order and the applicable sales tax rate. Prices and availability of products on the Sites are subject to change without notice. Errors will be corrected when discovered and Wayfair reserves the right to revoke any stated offer and to correct any error, inaccuracy, or omission (including after an order has been submitted). Certain orders constitute improper use of the Sites and the Wayfair Rewards Program described below. Wayfair reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to refuse or cancel any order for any reason. Your account may also be restricted or terminated for any reason, at Wayfair's sole discretion.

For “Flash Deals”, where a product is temporarily being sold at a reduced price, an additional strikethrough price is presented that represents a recent previous price before the Flash Deal promotion. The "Sale" tag on a product listing on our Sites signifies that we are selling the product at a discount from a price in the previous 90 days. The Wayfair's Choice badge represents a shortlist of highly-rated, well-priced products we know customers love.</span></div><div class="bodytext"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 14px;">When we use the term “Closeout,” we mean either that the product has been permanently reduced and will not return to the original price or that the product is temporarily being sold at a reduced price in order to clear an overstock of either Wayfair or supplier inventory. Prices of products listed on our Sites as “Closeout” may fluctuate during the “Closeout” promotion period for such products.

Covered Disputes shall be interpreted broadly.</strong></span></div><h3><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px;"><strong>Mandatory Informal Dispute Resolution</strong></span></h3><div class="bodytext"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 14px;">Wayfair values its customers and seeks to resolve disputes informally where possible. Before formally pursuing a Covered Dispute in arbitration, you agree to first send a detailed notice (“Notice”) to Wayfair by email at <a href="mailto:legal@wayfair.com" target="_blank" title="Email Us"><u style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">legal@wayfair.com</u></a>. If Wayfair has a dispute with you, Wayfair agrees to first send a detailed Notice to your e-mail address on file with us. Your Notice must contain all of the following information: (1) your full name; (2) your address, telephone number, and email address; (3) information sufficient for Wayfair to identify any transaction at issue (e.g., your order number, order confirmation communication, etc.); and (4) a detailed description of your dispute, the nature and basis of your claim(s), and the nature and basis of the relief you are seeking with a calculation for it. You must personally sign this Notice. Wayfair’s Notice will likewise set forth (1) information sufficient for you to identify any transaction at issue and (2) a detailed description of our dispute, the nature and basis of our claim(s), and the nature and basis of the relief we are seeking with a calculation for it. You and Wayfair agree to negotiate in good faith about the dispute in an effort to swiftly resolve it to your satisfaction without the need for a formal proceeding. Should Wayfair request a telephone conference with you in an effort to resolve your dispute as part of this informal process, you agree to personally participate (with your counsel if you are represented). This process should result in resolution of the dispute, but if for some reason it is not resolved within 60 days after receipt of a fully completed Notice and the parties have not agreed to extend this time period, you or Wayfair may initiate an arbitration. Compliance with and completion of this mandatory informal dispute resolution process is a condition precedent to filing any demand for arbitration. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in this process. Unless prohibited by applicable law, the arbitration administrator shall not accept or administer any demand for arbitration unless the claimant has certified in writing that they have fully complied with this process. This certification shall be personally signed by you or Wayfair. A court shall have the authority to enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitrations without first providing a fully completed Notice and participating in good faith in this informal dispute resolution process.</span></div><h3><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px;"><strong>Initiating Arbitration and Arbitration Rules</strong></span></h3><div class="bodytext"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 14px;">Any arbitration between you and Wayfair shall be administered by National Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM”) in accordance with NAM’s operative Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (the “NAM Rules”) in effect at the time any demand for arbitration is filed with NAM, as modified by this Legal Disputes Section. For a copy of the NAM Rules, please visit https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms or contact NAM at NAM’s National Processing Center at 990 Stewart Avenue, 1st Floor, Garden City, NY 11530 and email address commercial@namadr.com. If NAM is unavailable or unwilling to administer the proceeding under the Legal Disputes Section as written, the parties agree that the arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) pursuant to the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules and the Consumer Due Process Protocol (collectively, "AAA Rules") in effect at the time any demand for arbitration is filed with AAA, as modified by this Legal Disputes Section. If the AAA is unavailable or unwilling to apply this Legal Disputes Section as written, the parties shall mutually agree on an alternative administrator that will administer the proceeding under the Legal Disputes Section as written. If the parties are unable to agree, they will petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint an arbitration administrator that will do so. Any arbitration will be held before a single neutral arbitrator.</span></div><div class="bodytext"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 14px;">To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send the demand for arbitration or arbitration notice form made available from the arbitration administrator and supplement that form with a detailed description of your claim, including with the information required for your Notice and the accompanying signed certification of compliance with the informal process referenced above (collectively referred to as “demand for arbitration”), to NAM (or to AAA if it is the administrator as set forth above). You must personally sign your demand for arbitration. You agree to also send Wayfair a copy of your demand for arbitration at <a href="mailto:legal@wayfair.com" target="_blank" title="Email Us"><u style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">legal@wayfair.com</u></a>. If Wayfair initiates arbitration, we will send a copy of our demand for arbitration to your email address on file with us.</span></div><div class="bodytext"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 14px;">You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, virtually, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another location reasonably convenient for you, or at a mutually agreed-upon location. Wayfair reserves the right to request an in-person or videoconference hearing at any point within 14 days after its deadline to file any answer. After that time, Wayfair retains the right to request an in-person or virtual hearing from the arbitrator, which the arbitrator may elect to require along with your participation (with your counsel if you are represented). Should a hearing take place in person, it shall take place consistent with the geographic parameters set forth above.</span></div><h3><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px;"><strong>Arbitration Fees</strong></span></h3><div class="bodytext"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 14px;">Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the NAM Rules (or the AAA Rules should AAA be the designated administrator as set forth above). Upon a showing of financial hardship, Wayfair will consider your request to promptly reimburse your portion of the arbitration fees provided for in the NAM (or AAA) Rules.</span></div><h3><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px;"><strong>Arbitration Authority</strong></span></h3><div class="bodytext"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 14px;"><strong>The arbitrator has the sole authority to and shall address all claims or arguments by both parties concerning the formation, legality, and enforceability of this arbitration clause, the scope of this clause, and the arbitrability of any claim or issue arising between us.</strong></span></div><div class="bodytext"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 14px;">There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. The arbitrator may not award relief for or against anyone who is not a party to the proceeding. The arbitrator is bound by and must follow the terms of these Terms of Use as a court would. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to address the essential findings and conclusions of law on which the award is based. The arbitration award shall be binding only between you and Wayfair and shall have no preclusive effect in any other arbitration or proceeding involving a different party, provided that the arbitrator may consider rulings in other arbitrations involving different individuals. The arbitrator may award fees and costs as provided by the NAM Rules (or the AAA Rules if AAA is the designated administrator as set forth above) or to the extent such fees and costs could be awarded in court or if the arbitrator determines that a claim, proceeding, or defense was frivolous or brought for harassment, for an improper purpose, or in bad faith. The arbitrator shall apply the provisions of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68 after entry of the award.</span></div><h3><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px;"><strong>Sole Exceptions to Arbitration</strong></span></h3><div class="bodytext"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 14px;">Notwithstanding the foregoing, in lieu of arbitration: (1) either you or Wayfair may elect to have an individual claim heard in small claims court consistent with any applicable jurisdictional and monetary limits that may apply, provided that it is brought and maintained as an individual claim and is not appealed or removed to any court of general jurisdiction; and (2) you agree that you or Wayfair may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.</span></div><h3><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px;"><strong>Jury Trial and Class Action Waiver</strong></span></h3><div class="bodytext"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 14px;"><strong>Except as the Terms of Use otherwise provide and to the fullest extent permitted by law, you and Wayfair acknowledge and agree that you are each waiving the right to a trial by jury and to the litigation of disputes in state or federal courts of general jurisdiction. The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action/class arbitration or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. You and Wayfair may not be plaintiffs or class members in any purported class, collective, private attorney general, or representative proceeding, or otherwise make or proceed with any claim on a collective or consolidated basis, and may each bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity. As referenced above, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only on an individual basis and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim. If a court determines that this class action waiver is not enforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief and all appeals from that decision have been exhausted (or the decision is otherwise final), then the parties agree that that particular claim or request for relief shall proceed in court but shall be stayed pending arbitration of the remaining claims.</strong></span></div><h3><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px;"><strong>Special Additional Procedures for Mass Arbitration</strong></span></h3><div class="bodytext"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 14px;">If 25 or more individuals seek to initiate arbitrations with Wayfair raising similar claims, and counsel for the individuals bringing the claims are the same or coordinated or the claims are otherwise coordinated (“Mass Claims”), you and Wayfair agree that these additional procedures shall apply, along with the applicable NAM Rules (or the applicable AAA Rules if AAA is the administrator as set forth above). You understand and agree that if you choose to initiate your claim as part of Mass Claims, the adjudication of your claim might be delayed. Counsel for the individuals and counsel for Wayfair shall each select 15 cases (per side) to be filed in and proceed in arbitration in bellwether proceedings to be resolved individually. Each case shall be assigned to a separate and different arbitrator. In the meantime, no other cases may be filed or deemed filed in arbitration, and the arbitration administrator shall not accept or administer arbitrations commenced in violation of these procedures. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining cases after the conclusion of the first stage of bellwether proceedings, each side may select another 15 cases (per side) to be filed in and proceed in arbitration in a second set of bellwether proceedings to be resolved individually. Each case shall be assigned to a separate and different arbitrator. This process shall continue consistent with this staged process of administering and moving forward a maximum of 30 individual arbitration proceedings at a time until the parties are able to resolve all of the Mass Claims, either through settlement or arbitration. If these additional mass arbitration procedures apply to your claim, any applicable statute of limitations shall be tolled from the time the first cases are selected for a bellwether proceeding until your claim is selected for a bellwether proceeding, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved. A court shall have the authority to enforce these mass arbitration procedures and, if necessary, to enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitrations.</span></div><h3><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px;"><strong>Governing Law</strong></span></h3><div class="bodytext"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 14px;">You and Wayfair agree that any claim between us involves commerce under, and is governed exclusively by, the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA") and federal law, and not by any state or local laws, or the laws of other countries, concerning or purporting to place limits on the availability or scope of arbitration or in any way imposing requirements beyond or inconsistent with those set forth in the FAA.

Eligibility. </strong>We will automatically enroll you in the Program when the Bank opens your Credit Card. You will remain enrolled in the Program as long as your Credit Card is in Good Standing and we continue to offer the Program. “Good Standing” means (1) your Credit Card is open to new charges and not over your credit limit, (2) your Credit Card is not more than 60 days past due or otherwise in default, (3) your Credit Card is not flagged as lost, stolen, or fraudulent according to the Bank’s records, (4) your Credit Card is not in a hardship or workout program, and (5) you are not subject to a credit counseling arrangement relating to your Credit Card.

Earning Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars. </strong>The Program is limited to earning Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars for Net Qualifying Purchases. Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars earned on Net Qualifying Purchases using your Credit Card will be accumulated into one overall Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars total for your Account, rounded to the nearest cent. “Net Qualifying Purchases” are purchases of goods and services using your Credit Card and the Credit Card(s) of your Authorized User(s), if any, minus any returns, refunds, discounts by using Reward Dollars, promotions or credit adjustments.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 20px;"><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars will be calculated by multiplying the amount of each Net Qualifying Purchase by the applicable percentage to determine the number of Reward Dollars received for that purchase. The calculation will be done at the time of shipment. If items from a single order are shipped separately, the Reward Dollars will be calculated separately for each shipment. For non-Wayfair Net Qualifying Purchases, the calculation could be done at the time of purchase or shipment depending on the merchant.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 20px;"><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Your Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars will be stored in your Account in dollars and cents and rounded to the nearest cent. Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars are not earned on, and the term “Net Qualifying Purchases” does not include: returns, refunds, credit adjustments, unauthorized or fraudulent charges, charges that violate the terms of your Card Agreement, balance transfers, convenience checks, cash advances or any other transaction treated like a cash advance, lottery tickets, gaming chips and similar transactions, interest, fees, purchases where promotional financing is applied, and any portion of a purchase made with Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 20px;"><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">We have the right to deduct Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars from your Account balance for charges that were not or do not remain Net Qualifying Purchases. If your Account balance goes negative, you must first earn Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars to bring your Account balance to zero before earning any Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars eligible for redemption. Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars earned have no cash value and may not be used as payment of any outstanding obligation to the Bank or its affiliates or to Wayfair.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><strong>(a) Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars for Net Qualifying Purchases</strong><strong>. </strong>You will earn Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars for Net Qualifying Purchases so long as your Credit Card is in Good Standing.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 60px;"><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">i.

Grocery or food purchases made at convenience stores, gas stations, warehouse clubs, supercenters and discount stores may only receive 1%, not 3%, as determined by Wayfair in its discretion, due to merchant codes (as further described below) which are out of the control of the Bank or Wayfair.</em></span></li><li><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">2% on Net Qualifying Purchases for Qualifying Online Purchases. Qualifying Online Purchases are those made via a computer network. Not all online transactions will be considered Qualifying Online Purchases. Qualifying Online Purchases do not include the following types of purchases in the following categories: subscription, membership or recurring purchases; utilities, cable / satellite television and telephone; insurance; medical and healthcare providers; government services, taxes and tolls; education including schools or other teaching institutions; contractor, professional, financial, legal, personal and business services; repair services, direct marketing; purchases that are manually keyed by a merchant; or online purchases made through mobile / wireless technology, depending on how the technology is set up to process the purchase. These excluded purchases may only earn 1%, not 2%. We reserve the exclusive right to determine which purchases are eligible for additional Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars. Purchases made on our Sites will earn 5%, all other Qualifying Online Purchases made outside of our Sites will earn 2%.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">1% on all other Net Qualifying Purchases with your Wayfair Mastercard.</span></li></ul></li></ul><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">For purchases not made on our Sites, merchants must submit charges under the appropriate merchant code or industry code to be eligible as Net Qualifying Purchases and / or Qualifying Online Purchases in the different categories. Neither Wayfair nor Citibank determine whether merchants appropriately identify all transactions made on a credit card, but Wayfair does reserve the right to determine which purchases qualify for Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars you earn may not be combined with Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars earned by anyone else (other than your Authorized User(s), if applicable. Authorized user(s) Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars are automatically added to the primary Account Holder’s Account total.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><strong>(b) Promotional Financing. </strong>If promotional financing is available on an individual Net Qualifying Purchase at one of our Sites, you must choose between promotional financing and earning Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars. If promotional financing is selected, no Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars will be earned on that purchase. You will be able to select from eligible options during checkout. All relevant disclosures for promotional financing plans will be provided during checkout, prior to purchase.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><strong>(c) Rewards for Special Offers.</strong> From time to time, we may make special offers for you to earn additional Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars on specific purchases. The terms and conditions for such special offers (such as which purchases qualify and the number of additional Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars you may earn) will be disclosed at the time of offer. Please check those terms and conditions carefully, as there may be important conditions or limitations (such as blackout periods, reward limitations or exclusions). You may have to register to qualify for the offer. Availability of any special offer is subject to change without notice. Any such change or withdrawal will not affect bonus Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars already earned. Your Net Qualifying Purchase must be completed and the transaction charged to your Credit Card during the special offer period in order for you to earn the applicable bonus Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars. During special offer periods, making a return in the same transaction as your purchase may result in earning fewer Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars because Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars are calculated off of your Net Qualifying Purchase (in this case, your purchase minus return).</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In the event an offer is provided to make purchases using your Credit Card where a minimum purchase amount is required, such amount shall be calculated after applying any eligible discounts and excluding all rewards, fees (including shipping fees) and taxes related to the purchase. Purchases where a special discount has already been applied may be excluded from any such offers.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><strong>(d) Posting of Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars Earned; Forfeiture. </strong>Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars earned on purchases made at our Sites will be posted to your Account balance under “My Account” on the Sites within 48 hours from the day you take the merchandise with you or, if we are shipping or delivering your purchase, 48 hours from the day we ship or deliver it. Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars earned on purchases not made on our Sites will be posted to your Account balance after your billing cycle. At any time, we may verify and adjust your Account balance based on our records and based on certain purchases not constituting, or no longer constituting, Net Qualifying Purchases. Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars not redeemed will be carried over to the following statement period.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Except as otherwise provided by applicable law, you will forfeit all unused Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars if you attempt to violate the prohibitions on the transfer of Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars, if you file for bankruptcy, or your participation in the Program is terminated or your Credit Card is closed for any reason. You will also forfeit Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars as described below and in Section 9. You will not receive any compensation or new Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars for your Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars that are forfeited. You will forfeit unused Reward dollars in certain circumstances including if your account is closed or participation in the program is terminated unless prohibited by law.

If the Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars order is fulfilled and we later discover that you did not have a sufficient balance of Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars in your Account, in addition to any other actions we may take, this may result in a negative Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars balance and future Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars earnings will be applied to the negative balance until such time as sufficient Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars are earned to cover the negative balance. You will not be able to redeem Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars until you again have a positive balance.

Wayfair Credit Card Rewards Disputes.</strong> If Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars you believe were earned have not been timely posted to your Account balance, you may dispute your Account balance (“Rewards Dispute”) by calling 1-866-513-5795. If you believe that a purchase made on your Credit Card should have resulted in the addition of Wayfair Credit Card Rewards to your accumulated balance, and such rewards are not reflected in the accumulated Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars balance within forty-five (45) days of the date on which the purchase posted to your Credit Card (“Rewards Dispute”), notify us immediately. We will use reasonable efforts to investigate your Rewards Dispute if you notify us within 90 days of the posting date. If you do not notify us within that period, you waive your right to make a Rewards Dispute with respect to that purchase. We may require you to provide written confirmation of the dispute and the applicable purchase receipt and may decline to investigate further if you do not provide the requested confirmation or a valid receipt. Upon completion of the investigation, we will have no further responsibilities if you later reassert the same Rewards Dispute. <strong>Please note that the dispute rights with respect to your Credit Card under the Card Agreement do not apply to these Terms or to your rights and remedies under these Terms, which are solely as set forth in these Terms. Your sole and exclusive remedy, and our maximum liability to you, in the event you prevail in a Rewards Dispute, is for us to credit the disputed Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars to your Account balance. Any questions or disputes about your purchase are governed by your Card Agreement and should be directed to the Bank.</strong></span></div><div style="margin-left: 20px;"><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><strong>7.

If we take any other action, we will not lose any rights under these Program Terms.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 20px;"><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Unless otherwise required by law or our agreements with you, neither Wayfair nor the Bank, nor any of our or its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, service providers, or agents will be liable to you, or anyone making a claim on your behalf, in connection with (a) any termination of, change in, or suspension of the Program; (b) any claim relating to products purchased using any Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars obtained through the Program; (c) any loss, damage, expense or inconvenience caused by any occurrence outside of our control; or (d) any taxes that you incur as a result of receiving or redeeming Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any liability that we or they may have to you in connection with the Program shall be limited to the amount of any Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars you have earned in accordance with these Terms.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 20px;"><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><strong>8.

Changes.</strong> Subject to any requirements or limitations of applicable law, we may at any time for any reason add to, change, limit, or terminate the Program or these Terms. To the extent allowed by applicable law, (a) changes may apply retroactively, and may affect outstanding transactions and Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars, and may result in you involuntarily forfeiting Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars you have earned, and (b) changes will not affect issued or redeemed Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars except to the extent allowed by applicable law.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 20px;"><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><strong>10.

Governing Law; Assignment. </strong>The Program and these Terms are governed by federal law and, to the extent state law applies, the laws of the State of Delaware, without any reference to its choice of law provisions. You may not assign your rights or obligations under these Terms to any other person or entity. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 20px;"><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">“Claim,” as used in these Terms means any claim, dispute or controversy that in any way arises from or relates to these Terms.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 20px;"><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><strong>12. Arbitration.</strong> Any dispute between you and Wayfair arising from or relating to these Terms and their interpretation or the breach, termination or validity thereof, the relationships which result from these Terms, including disputes about the validity, scope or enforceability of this arbitration provision (collectively, “Covered Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration. Prior to initiating any arbitration, the initiating party will give the other party at least 60-days' advanced written notice of its intent to file for arbitration. Wayfair will provide such notice by email to your email address on file with Wayfair and you must provide such notice by email to legal@wayfair.com.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 20px;"><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">During such 60-day notice period, the parties will endeavor to settle any Covered Disputes amicably by mutual discussions. Failing such amicable settlement and expiration of the notice period, either party may initiate arbitration. The arbitrator will conduct any arbitration proceedings by telephone or video conference unless in-person appearances are requested by you or Wayfair and approved by the arbitrator. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location mutually agreed upon by you and Wayfair, or, in the absence of such agreement, at a location determined by the arbitrator. The arbitrator will have the power to grant whatever relief would be available in court under law or in equity and any award of the arbitrator(s) will be final and binding on each of the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. Arbitrator will apply applicable law and the provisions of these Terms and the failure to do so will be deemed an excess of arbitral authority and grounds for judicial review. Wayfair and you agree that any Covered Dispute hereunder will be submitted to arbitration on an individual basis only. Neither Wayfair nor you are entitled to arbitrate any Covered Dispute as a class, representative or private attorney action and the arbitrator(s) will have no authority to proceed on a class, representative or private attorney general basis. If any provision of the agreement to arbitrate in this section is found illegal or unenforceable, the remaining arbitration terms shall continue to be fully valid, binding, and enforceable (but in no case will there be a class, representative or private attorney general arbitration). These Terms and related transactions will be subject to and governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. sec. 1-16 (FAA) and, where otherwise applicable, as set forth in Section 11 hereof.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 20px;"><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><strong>13. Entire Agreement; Severability; Conflicts; No Waiver. </strong>These Terms contain the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Program, and supersede any previous terms and conditions governing the Program we may have provided to you. The Program is not available where and to the extent prohibited by law. If any part of these Terms conflict with applicable law, that provision will be deemed severed from these Terms and the remainder of the Terms will remain in effect. We will not lose our rights under these Terms because we delay or do not enforce them. All waivers of any of these Terms by us must be in a writing executed by someone with authority to bind us.<br><br></span></div>

                        <h1><span style="font-size: 24px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Wayfair Professional Credit Card Rewards Program Terms (“Terms”)</span></h1><div><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">These Rewards Terms (the “Rewards Terms”) apply to the Wayfair Professional Credit Card issued by Capital One, N.A. ("Capital One" or "Bank"). These Rewards Terms are in addition to those set forth in your Customer Agreement governing your Wayfair Professional Credit Card Account (your "Account"). Your Customer Agreement remains in full force and effect and is unaffected by these Rewards Terms. Any capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meaning as set forth in the Customer Agreement.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Important note: These Rewards Terms apply to any disputes you may have with respect to the Wayfair Professional Credit Card Rewards Program ("Rewards Program"). Any disputes between you and Capital One related to your Account are governed by your Customer Agreement with Capital One. These Rewards Terms are subject to the arbitration provision included in the Rewards Terms that limit our liability to you, require you to resolve disputes with us on an individual basis and not as a part of any class or representative action, and through final and binding arbitration. Please read these Rewards Terms carefully for important information about your rights and obligations in the Rewards Program. By participating in the Rewards Program, you agree to these Rewards Terms.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><strong>Earning Wayfair Professional Credit Card Reward Dollars.</strong> Wayfair Professional Credit Card Reward Dollars can be earned on <em>Net Eligible Purchases</em> with Wayfair and associated Wayfair brand websites ("Sites"), including jossandmain.com, birchlane.com, allmodern.com, and perigold.com.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><em>Net Eligible Purchases</em> are purchases of goods and services using your Wayfair Professional Credit Card account. <em>Net Eligible Purchases</em> include purchases made by Authorized Purchasers, minus any returns, refunds, discounts by using your earned points, promotions or credit adjustments. Reward Dollars will be accumulated as dollars and cents, rounded to the nearest cent, at the account level. Wayfair Reward Dollars are not earned on, and the term <em>Net Eligible Purchases</em> does not include: returns, refunds, credit adjustments, unauthorized or fraudulent charges, charges that violate the terms of your Customer Card Agreement, interest fees, shipping and freight, and purchases where special financing is applied. We have the right to deduct Wayfair Professional Credit Card Reward Dollars for charges that were not or do not remain <em>Net Eligible Purchases</em>. As a result, if your Reward Dollar balance becomes negative, you must first earn Reward Dollars to bring your balance to zero before being eligible to redeem. Reward Dollars cannot be used to meet minimum payment obligations to Capital One or its affiliates. Account credits lower your account balance, but do not count toward your minimum monthly payment obligation.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">You cannot earn Reward Dollars using any other Wayfair Professional financing solution including the Wayfair Professional Flex Account. Reward Dollars will begin accruing after you are approved for a Wayfair Professional Credit Card and will not be provided retroactively.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><strong>Wayfair Professional Credit Card Reward Dollars for Net Eligible Purchases.</strong> You will earn 2% Reward Dollars for <em>Net Eligible Purchases</em> as long as your Wayfair Professional Credit Card account is in good standing meaning not closed, suspended, restricted, delinquent, or otherwise in default.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><strong>Special Financing.</strong> If special financing is available on an individual <em>Net Eligible Purchase</em> at Wayfair or one of our Sites, no Reward Dollars will be earned on that purchase. All relevant disclosures for special financing plans will be provided during checkout, prior to purchase.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><strong>Rewards for Special Offers.</strong> From time to time, we may make special offers for you to earn additional Reward Dollars on specific <em>Net Eligible Purchases</em>. The terms and conditions for such special offers (such as which purchases qualify and the number of additional Reward Dollars that can be earned) will be disclosed at the time of offer. Please check those terms and conditions carefully, as there may be important conditions or limitations (such as blackout periods, reward limitations or exclusions). You may have to register to qualify for the offer. Any such change or withdrawal will not affect any additional Reward Dollars already earned. Your <em>Net Eligible Purchases</em> must be completed, and the transaction charged to your Wayfair Professional Credit Card Account, during the special offer period in order for you to earn the applicable bonus Reward Dollars. During special offer periods, making a return in the same transaction as your purchase may result in earning fewer Reward Dollars because Reward Dollars are calculated off of your <em>Net Eligible Purchases</em> (in this case, your purchase minus return). In the event an offer is provided to make purchases using your Wayfair Professional Credit Card where a minimum purchase amount is required, such amount shall be calculated after applying any eligible discounts and excluding all rewards, fees (including shipping fees) and taxes related to the purchase. Purchases where a special discount has already been applied may be excluded from any such offers.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><strong>Posting of Wayfair Professional Credit Card Reward Dollars Earned; Forfeiture.</strong> Reward Dollars earned on <em>Net Eligible Purchases</em> made at Wayfair.com and our Sites will be added to your Rewards balance under "My Account" on Wayfair.com within 48 hours of when the items purchased are shipped to you. Except as otherwise provided by applicable law, you will forfeit all unused Reward Dollars if you attempt to violate the prohibitions on the transfer of Reward Dollars, if you file for bankruptcy, or your participation in the Wayfair Professional Credit Card program is terminated or your account is closed for any reason. You may also forfeit Reward Dollars as described below, unless prohibited by applicable law. Subject to limitations of applicable law, you will not receive any compensation or new Reward Dollars for any forfeited Reward Dollars. Reward Dollars may not be sold, purchased, brokered, bartered, transferred or altered in any way by you. Any attempted transaction of such sort will automatically be void. Anyone engaging in such transactions may be liable for damages to us, including, but not limited to consequential damages, third party damages, transaction costs, attorney's fees and court costs. Any violation of these provisions will result in termination of your eligibility to participate in the Rewards Program and forfeiture of unused Reward Dollars, unless prohibited by law.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><strong>Redeeming Wayfair Professional Credit Card Rewards Dollars.</strong> Wayfair Reward Dollars may only be redeemed by account holders. Reward Dollars are valid for the life of the account and can be redeemed at any point as long as your account is active and in good standing. You may apply available Reward Dollars at the time of checkout when you use your Wayfair Professional Credit Card. We reserve the right to change the amount required to earn Reward Dollars or otherwise modify the Rewards program at any time. In the event that a return, refund or credit adjustment results in a negative Reward Dollars balance, any future Reward Dollars earned must be applied to the negative balance before you can redeem. If, by chance, your Reward Dollars are redeemed from a negative balance, any earned Reward Dollars must be applied to the balance, before redeeming, until it is no longer negative. All redemptions of Reward Dollars are final.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Any additional exclusions or limitations for use of Reward Dollars may be provided to you at time of checkout. To the extent allowed by applicable law, we may cancel any earned or pending Reward Dollars if we become insolvent, unable to pay our debts when due, file an action under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or have such an action filed against us.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><strong>Communications, Program Activity and Customer Service.</strong> We may communicate with you regarding any matter related to your Rewards Dollars via mail, telephone, text or SMS, or electronic communication. You may update your contact information under Account Settings on any of the Sites or by calling 1-866-513-5795. We are not responsible for communications related to the Rewards Program that are lost due to change of address or other incorrect contact information. If you want to know whether your Rewards Dollars were properly redeemed, or you want to ask any other question regarding the Rewards Program, call Wayfair at 1-866-513-5795.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><strong>Wayfair Professional Credit Card Rewards Disputes.</strong> If Reward Dollars you believe were earned have not been timely posted to your account, you may file a dispute ("Rewards Dispute") by calling Wayfair at 1-866-513-5795. If you believe that a purchase(s) made using your Wayfair Professional Credit Card should have resulted in earned rewards, and such rewards are not reflected in your Rewards balance within forty-eight (48) hours of when the items purchased are shipped to you, please contact us. We will use reasonable efforts to investigate your Rewards Dispute if you notify us within 90 days of the shipping date. If you do not notify us within that period, you waive your right to make a Rewards Dispute with respect to that purchase. We may require you to provide written confirmation of the dispute, the applicable purchase receipt, and other documentation related to the dispute. If you do not respond to our requests or submit a timely response, we will investigate and decide your dispute based on the information we have. <strong>Please note that the Rewards Dispute process is solely set forth in these terms and not your Wayfair Professional Credit Card Customer Agreement. Any questions or disputes about your Wayfair Professional Credit Card purchases are governed by your Customer Agreement and should be directed to Capital One.</strong></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><strong>Non-Waiver and Limited Liability.</strong> We may waive any obligation you have under these Rewards Terms without losing our right at a later time to enforce that same obligation. We will not lose any of our rights under these Rewards Terms if we delay taking action for any reason. If we take any other action, we will not lose any rights under these Rewards Terms. Unless otherwise required by law or our agreements with you, neither Wayfair nor Capital One, nor any of our or its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, service providers, or agents will be liable to you, or anyone making a claim on your behalf, in connection with (a) any termination of, change in, or suspension of the Rewards Program; (b) any claim relating to products purchased using any Reward Dollars obtained through the Rewards Program; (c) any loss, damage, expense or inconvenience caused by any occurrence outside of our control; or (d) any taxes that you incur as a result of receiving or redeeming Wayfair Credit Card Rewards Dollars. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any liability that we or they may have to you in connection with the Program shall be limited to the amount of any Reward Dollars you have earned in accordance with these Rewards Terms.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><strong>No Warranties.</strong> Capital One does not: (a) endorse Reward Dollars or products or services purchased at the Sites using Wayfair Rewards Dollars; (b) make any express or implied warranty regarding Reward Dollars or products or services purchased at the Sites; (c) guarantee the performance of Reward Dollars or products or services purchased on the Sites; or (d) offer, operate or control Reward Dollars offered through this Rewards Program.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><strong>Changes.</strong> Subject to any requirements or limitations of applicable law, we may at any time for any reason add to, change, limit, or terminate these Rewards Terms. To the extent allowed by applicable law, (a) changes may apply retroactively, and may affect outstanding transactions and Reward Dollars, and may result in you involuntarily forfeiting Reward Dollars you have earned, and (b) changes will not affect issued or redeemed Reward Dollars except to the extent allowed by applicable law.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><strong>Taxes.</strong> You are solely liable for any applicable taxes arising out of the accrual or use of Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars. Consult your tax advisor concerning such tax consequences.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><strong>Governing Law; Assignment.</strong> The Wayfair Professional Reward Dollars Program and these Rewards Terms are governed by federal law and, to the extent state law applies, the laws of the State of Delaware, without any reference to its choice of law provisions. You may not assign your rights or obligations under these Rewards Terms to any other person or entity. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THESE REWARDS TERMS ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. "Claim," as used in these Rewards Terms, means any claim, dispute or controversy that in any way arises from or relates to these Rewards Terms.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><strong>Arbitration.</strong> Any dispute between you and Wayfair arising from or relating to these Rewards Terms and their interpretation or the breach, termination or validity thereof, the relationships which result from these Rewards Terms, including disputes about the validity, scope or enforceability of this arbitration provision (collectively, "Covered Disputes") will be settled by binding arbitration. Prior to initiating any arbitration, the initiating party will give the other party at least 60-days' advanced written notice of its intent to file for arbitration. Wayfair will provide such notice by email to your e-mail address on file with Wayfair and you must provide such notice by email to <a alt="Email legal@wayfair.com" href="mailto:legal@wayfair.com"><u>legal@wayfair.com</u></a>. During such 60-day notice period, the parties will endeavor to settle amicably by mutual discussions any Covered Disputes. Failing such amicable settlement and expiration of the notice period, either party may initiate arbitration. The arbitrator will conduct any arbitration proceedings by telephone or videoconference unless in-person appearances are requested by you or Wayfair and approved by the arbitrator. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location mutually agreed upon by you and Wayfair, or, in the absence of such agreement, at a location determined by the arbitrator. The arbitrator will have the power to grant whatever relief would be available in court under law or in equity and any award of the arbitrator(s) will be final and binding on each of the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. Arbitrator will apply applicable law and the provisions of these Terms and the failure to do so will be deemed an excess of arbitral authority and grounds for judicial review. Wayfair and you agree that any Covered Dispute hereunder will be submitted to arbitration on an individual basis only. Neither Wayfair nor you are entitled to arbitrate any Covered Dispute as a class, representative or private attorney action and the arbitrator(s) will have no authority to proceed on a class, representative or private attorney general basis. If any provision of the agreement to arbitrate in this section is found illegal or unenforceable, the remaining arbitration terms shall continue to be fully valid, binding, and enforceable (but in no case will there be a class, representative or private attorney general arbitration). These Rewards Terms and related transactions will be subject to and governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. sec. 1-16 (FAA) and, where otherwise applicable, as set forth in Section 11 hereof.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><strong>Entire Agreement; Severability; Conflicts; No Waiver.</strong> These Rewards Terms contain the entire agreement between you and Wayfair regarding the Rewards Program, and supersede any previous terms and conditions governing the Rewards Program we may have provided to you. The Rewards Program is not available where and to the extent prohibited by law. If any part of these Rewards Terms conflict with applicable law, that provision will be deemed severed from these Rewards Terms and the remainder of the Rewards Terms will remain in effect. We will not lose our rights under these Rewards Terms because we delay or do not enforce them. All waivers of any of these Rewards Terms by us must be in a writing executed by someone with authority to bind us.</span></div>
