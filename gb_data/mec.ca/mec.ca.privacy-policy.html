<p>We take protection of your personal information seriously. To help protect your information, we use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect against unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, and disposal of your personal information.  We also require our employees and Service Providers to respect and adhere to confidentiality obligations related to your personal information.  Despite these efforts, please bear in mind that no internet or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure or error free and no security system is impenetrable.  We cannot always guarantee the security of personal information.  Any transmission of your personal information is at your own risk.</p>

<p><em>Protecting Your Own Personal Information</em></p>
<p>It is important to guard your privacy when you are online, including while you are interacting with MEC.  Steps you can take to protect your personal information include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>External websites</strong>: the MEC website includes links to external websites, which are not governed by this Notice.  MEC is not responsible for the privacy practices, collection of personal information, or content of external websites.  You should read the privacy policies of these external websites and make an informed decision about whether you want to use these websites or services.</li>
<li><strong>Third party platforms</strong>: where we have enabled you to connect with other third party platforms in order to utilize their services in conjunction with our website, you may be subject to the privacy notices and other terms of those third party platforms, especially where you are providing your information directly to them.  You are responsible for reviewing and agreeing to those privacy notices and terms.  If you do not agree with those notices and terms, you should not use the services offered by such third party platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Unauthorized Access</strong>: you should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your MEC online account by, for example, choosing a robust password and keeping your login information and password private.  MEC is not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised usernames, passwords, or for any activity on your MEC online account via unauthorized password activity.

We may also collect your information from other customers or members if they provide us your information, for example if they have put you down as an emergency contact or bought you a gift from us. In certain cases, we may also collect information from private third parties, which could include information available from identity verification and fraud prevention services, or information from a third party who is collecting such information on behalf of MEC. \n\n*Personal Data We Derive.* We may draw inferences about you based on the personal information we collect.

2024","date":"2024-05-30","body":[{"primary":{"copy":[{"type":"preformatted","text":"Your climbing shoes are your most important piece of climbing gear. They form the foundation of your kit and are a necessity for every discipline within climbing. When choosing climbing shoes, whether they’re your first pair or your seventeenth, consider the fit, function, and performance. Those are the three things I thought about when reviewing the shoes in MEC's climbing assortment.\n\n### Climbing shoe fit\n\r\nShoes should fit snugly all around your foot, allowing no movement within the shoe and no air spaces or pockets. Read more about [How to choose climbing shoes](https://www.mec.ca/en/explore/choose-your-climbing-shoes). They shouldn’t be so tight that you have hot spots or significant pain, but keep in mind that a snug fit is a precision fit. As climbers, we drive lots of power through our feet, and a precision fit helps harness that power. \n\r\nModern climbing shoes won’t stretch much, especially if they’re lined, but you can expect them to break in and feel 1/3 up to 1/2 size bigger as they mould to your foot. Every shoe brand’s sizing fits a little differently though, so whenever possible, try before you buy!\n\r\nThe shape of your foot and the shape of a shoe need to be in sync for a perfect fit. Most shoes are offered in a high-volume (men’s) option and a low-volume (women's ) option. A shoe built on a low-volume last is usually narrower, with a lower cut, slimmer heel and less volume around the top of the foot.\r\n\n### Function and performance\nClimbing shoes are designed and refined for different types of climbing. The shape affects not just the fit, but the way a shoe performs. It’s important to select the right shoe to suit the climbing you do and the stage you’re at in your climbing progress. \n\r\nA flat-lasted, more symmetrical shoe will be more comfortable for beginners or climbers looking for an all-day shoe. They often have better support for edging and vertical climbing, a full outsole, a supportive midsole, and a lace closure. Laces let you ease the fit and you can modify the fit throughout a long day. \r\n","spans":[]}]},"items":[{}],"id":"markdowncopy$5db5e106-f44c-41e6-b32d-5db080604c4d","slice_type":"markdowncopy","slice_label":null},{"primary":{"copy":[{"type":"preformatted","text":"## Top picks for multi-pitch and all-day comfort\n","spans":[]}]},"items":[{}],"id":"markdowncopy$c1e52975-ed2e-4cc7-863c-df4a41fbdcc4","slice_type":"markdowncopy","slice_label":null},{"primary":{"image":{"dimensions":{"width":1080,"height":810},"alt":null,"copyright":null,"url":"https://images.prismic.io/mecheadless/Zl3__Zm069VX1a0p_LaSportivaFinale.jpg?auto=format,compress?auto=compress,format\u0026rect=500,0,4000,3000\u0026w=1080\u0026h=810","id":"Zl3__Zm069VX1a0p","edit":{"x":-135,"y":0,"zoom":0.27,"background":"#fff"}},"copy":"La Sportiva Finale, a top pick for multi pitch and all-day comfort.","link":{"link_type":"Any"}},"items":[{}],"id":"image$5ce25c3d-1953-4b4d-ac4b-a3811d887161","slice_type":"image","slice_label":null},{"primary":{"copy":[{"type":"preformatted","text":"#### La Sportiva Finale\nA fantastic and popular all-around shoe that prioritizes comfort for long days on the wall or at the gym.

A CO2 inflator is the fastest way to inflate a tube in case of a flat tire. Simply screw your cartridge on the threaded side, then press the inflator head on the valve like a regular pump.\r\n\r\nOnce the air starts releasing into the tire, hold the inflator firmly while it inflates, with another hand on the tire to feel the pressure. Watch out for your fingers as the cartridge will become very cold when the air is released.\r\n\r\n**Pro tip**: Before installing the new tube onto the rim, blow in the tube with your mouth to give it a round shape (or with a hand pump if you have one). This will help you place the tube properly inside the tire before adding pressure.\n\n##### [**MEC Hand Pump**](https://www.mec.ca/en/product/6025-536/hand-pump)\r\n\r\nIf CO2 cartridges are fast, they are not always reliable and certainly not forgiving if not used properly. I strongly recommend that you always carry a hand pump (a mini pump that fits in your bag). It’s easier to use and it will help you make sure the tube is placed correctly inside the tire as you add pressure.\r\n\r\nThis mini pump has a reversible valve head to fit any valve type, Presta or Schrader.\r\n\r\n**Pro tip:** If you need to choose between the inflator and the pump, pick the hand pump.\r\n","spans":[]}]},"items":[{}],"id":"markdowncopy$7357a2d6-5f76-44c4-b61e-25e784e69ab7","slice_type":"markdowncopy","slice_label":null},{"primary":{},"items":[{"label":"See more multi-tools","link":"https://www.mec.ca/en/products/cycling/bike-maintenance/bike-tools/bike-multi-tools","importance":"primary"}],"id":"action$489e8fe3-730d-4b79-b3bf-97ce5aab1cee","slice_type":"action","slice_label":null},{"primary":{"copy":[{"type":"preformatted","text":"## Chain lubricants and cleaners\r\n\r\n##### [**MEC Bio-Cycle 1L Chain Cleaner**](https://www.mec.ca/en/product/6022-444/bio-cycle-1l-chain-cleaner)\r\n\r\nIf you use your bicycle for commuting, chances are that you are riding in all sorts of conditions.

Great for protection against light rain or moisture.\r\n- **Gore-Tex:** Known for its waterproof and breathable properties, ideal for hiking in rainy or snowy conditions.\r\n- **G-1000 ®:** Developed by Fjallraven, G-1000 ® is a durable blend of 65% polyester and 35% cotton, often treated with Greenland Wax for enhanced weather resistance, suitable for rugged exploration and outdoor activities.\r\n- **Fortius™ DW 2.0:** Developed by Arc'teryx, Fortius™ DW 2.0 is known for its lightweight yet durable properties.
