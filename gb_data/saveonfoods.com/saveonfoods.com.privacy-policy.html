<h1 style="text-align: center; --fontSize: 24; line-height: 1.17;" data-fontsize="24" data-lineheight="28.08px" class="fusion-responsive-typography-calculated">PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;">(External)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Last Updated: January 19, 2024</p>
<p>Pattison Food Group Ltd. (“PFG”) adheres to the philosophy that our customers are one of our greatest assets and we will earn their trust. We operate our business with this philosophy in mind.</p>
<h2 data-fontsize="18" data-lineheight="30.42px" class="fusion-responsive-typography-calculated" style="--fontSize: 18; line-height: 1.69; --minFontSize: 18;">1. Introduction</h2>
<h3 data-fontsize="16" data-lineheight="24.96px" class="fusion-responsive-typography-calculated" style="--fontSize: 16; line-height: 1.56; --minFontSize: 16;">A. When Does this Privacy Policy Apply?</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy governs the collection, use and/or disclosure of Personal Information from external sources during the course of PFG’s business. It applies to the business activities of PFG, agents and affiliates in carrying out those activities. PFG may change and update this Privacy Policy at any time without notice. Revised versions of this Privacy Policy will be made available on our websites as well as from Customer Service in our stores and will be effective from the date of release.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party websites linked from our websites, which will be governed by their own privacy policies.</p>
<h3 data-fontsize="16" data-lineheight="24.96px" class="fusion-responsive-typography-calculated" style="--fontSize: 16; line-height: 1.56; --minFontSize: 16;">B. What is Personal Information?</h3>
<p>“Personal Information” is information about an identifiable individual, such as their name, date of birth, gender, home address, personal phone number, personal email address, Internet Protocol (IP) address, personal interests and shopping preferences. In this Privacy Policy, we explain what happens to the Personal Information we collect, why we collect it, and how it is used and/or disclosed.</p>
<h3 data-fontsize="16" data-lineheight="24.96px" class="fusion-responsive-typography-calculated" style="--fontSize: 16; line-height: 1.56; --minFontSize: 16;">C. What is Personal Health Information?</h3>
<p>We recognize that personal health information (PHI) is one of the most important types of Personal Information. This Privacy Policy also applies to the PHI we collect through our pharmacies. PHI refers to Personal Information that is related to a person’s health or the provision of health services to them. Examples are: medical histories, test and laboratory results, mental health conditions, insurance information and other Personal Information that our pharmacists use to provide quality care and to meet our legal and professional requirements.</p>
<h2 data-fontsize="18" data-lineheight="30.42px" class="fusion-responsive-typography-calculated" style="--fontSize: 18; line-height: 1.69; --minFontSize: 18;">2. PFG Privacy Principles</h2>
<p>PFG has adopted privacy practices consistent with the Canadian Standards Association’s “Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information”. This code contains ten (10) fair information principles generally described as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Accountability</strong> – An organization is responsible for Personal Information under its control and for designating at least one representative responsible for its compliance with such principles.</li>
<li><strong>Identifying Purposes</strong> – The purpose for which Personal Information is collected shall be identified on or before the time the Personal Information is collected.</li>
<li><strong>Consent</strong> – The consent of an individual is required for the collection, use or disclosure of Personal Information unless otherwise permitted by law.</li>
<li><strong>Limiting Collection of Personal Information</strong> – The collection of Personal Information shall be limited to that which is necessary for the identified purposes.</li>
<li><strong>Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention of Personal Information</strong> – Personal Information shall only be used or disclosed for the identified purpose(s) for which it was collected, unless otherwise allowed by law. Such Personal Information shall also only be retained for as long as is necessary for the fulfillment of such identified purposes.</li>
<li><strong>Accuracy</strong> – Personal Information collected shall be as accurate, complete and up to date as is necessary for the identified purposes.</li>
<li><strong>Safeguards and Safekeeping</strong> – Personal information shall be secured at a level appropriate to the sensitivity of the Personal Information.</li>
<li><strong>Openness</strong> – An organization shall make available information about its practices pertaining to the management of Personal Information.</li>
<li><strong>Individual Access</strong> – An individual shall be informed of the existence, use and disclosure of their Personal Information and shall be given access to such Personal Information. Such individual shall be entitled to query the accuracy and completeness of the Personal Information as well as have such Personal Information amended.</li>
<li><strong>Challenging Compliance</strong> – An individual shall be entitled to challenge concerns they may have with respect to an organization’s compliance with the fair information principles contained herein.</li>
</ol>

If you consent, we may send you emails such as those containing information on new products, services, events and/or promotions relating to PFG, and we may ask you about your satisfaction with any of PFG’s products or services.
