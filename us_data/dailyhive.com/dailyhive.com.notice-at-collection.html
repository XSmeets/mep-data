However, we may share with third party sites (e.g. Facebook, Google, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter) some data, with appropriate security measures, to show you relevant advertising on third party sites, as set out in section 7. Sometimes DH uses third parties to process your information on our behalf, for example to provide services or analysis. DH requires these third parties to comply strictly with its instructions and DH requires that they do not use your personal information for their own business purposes, unless you have explicitly consented to the use of your personal information in this way.</p>
<p>9. Offensive or inappropriate content on the DH website<br>
If you post or send content which may reasonably be deemed to be offensive, inappropriate or objectionable anywhere on or to the DH website or otherwise engage in any disruptive behaviour on any DH service, DH may remove such content.</p>
<p>Where DH reasonably believes that you are or may be in breach of any applicable laws, for example on hate speech, DH may disclose your personal information to relevant third parties, including to law enforcement agencies or your internet provider. DH would only do so in circumstances where such disclosure is permitted under applicable laws, including Personal Information Protection Act 2003.</p>
<p>10. What if I am a user aged under 18?<br>
If you are aged 18 or under, please get your parent/guardian’s permission before you provide any personal information to DH.</p>
<p>11. How long will DH keep my information?<br>
We will hold your personal information on our systems indefinitely unless requested to opt out.</p>
<p>Where you contribute content together with your personal information (User Generated Content or UGC) please refer to our Terms of Use for further information about how long we may store such material.</p>
<p>12. Can I delete my data?<br>
You can always remove yourself from an email newsletter by hitting the unsubscribe link within the email. For deletion of other data, you may contact dataprotection@dailyhive.com.</p>
<p>13. Can I find out what personal information DH holds about me?<br>
You have the right to request a copy of the personal information DH holds about you and to have any inaccuracies corrected. (We charge $10 for information requests and require you to prove your identity with 2 pieces of approved identification). We will use reasonable efforts consistent with our legal duty to supply, correct or delete personal information about you on our files. If you are within the UK, please address requests and questions about this or any other question about this Privacy and Cookies Policy to the Data Protection Officer, #400 – 1008 Homer Street, Vancouver, B.C., V6B 2X1 (Email: dataprotection@dailyhive.com).</p>

<p>14. What if I am accessing the DH website outside Canada?<br>
DH website is accessible worldwide. All personal information submitted by users will be processed in accordance with this Privacy and Cookies Policy (and any local terms that apply to certain areas of the site). Where there is a conflict, the local terms will apply.</p>
<p>15. Web browser cookies<br>
a) What is a Cookie?<br>
A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer, tablet or mobile phone (all referred to here as a “device”) web browser from a website’s computer and is stored on your device’s hard drive. Each website can send its own cookie to your web browser if your browser’s preferences allow it. Many websites do this whenever a user visits their website in order to track online traffic flows. Similar technologies are also often used within emails to understand whether the email has been read or if any links have been clicked. If you continue without changing your settings, we’ll assume that you are happy to receive all cookies on DH website. However, you can change your cookie settings at any time.</p>
<p>On the DH website, cookies record information about your online preferences and allow us to tailor our websites to your interests.</p>
<p>During the course of any visit to a DH website, the pages you see, along with a cookie, are downloaded to your device. Many websites do this, because cookies enable website publishers to do useful things like find out whether the device (and probably its user) has visited the website before. This is done on a repeat visit by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left there on the last visit.</p>
<p>b) How does DH use cookies?<br>
Information supplied by cookies can help us to understand the profile of our visitors and help us to provide you with a better user experience. For example, if on a previous visit you went to our DH Vancouver page, we might find this out from your cookie and direct you to dailyhive.com/vancouver on your second and subsequent direct visits to dailyhive.com. DH uses this type of information to help improve the services it provides to its users.</p>
<p>Additionally, DH uses cookies to serve some targeted advertising. Further information, including how to opt-out of receiving these cookies, can be found in the “How does DH use cookies for advertising” section of Using DH.</p>
<p>c) Third party cookies in embedded content on DH pages<br>
Please note that during your visits to the DH website you may notice some cookies that are not related to DH or DH’s contractors.</p>
<p>To support our journalism, we sometimes embed content from social media and other third party websites. These may include YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, SoundCloud, Vine, Instagram, Pinterest and Flickr. As a result, when you visit a page containing such content, you may be presented with cookies from these websites and these third party cookies may track your use of DH website. DH does not control the dissemination of these cookies and you should check the relevant third party’s website for more information. If you continue without changing your settings, we’ll assume that you are happy to receive all cookies on DH website. However, you can find out about changing your cookie settings here.</p>
<p>Where DH embeds content from social media and other third party websites, some websites may use Google Analytics to collect data about user behaviour for their own purposes. DH does not control this. For more information, see the Google webpage “How Google uses data when you use our partners’ sites or apps”.</p>
<p>d) DH cookies and how to reject cookies<br>
Full information about how DH uses cookies, and how to control what cookies are set on your device through DH website, can be found on Using DH.</p>
<p>It is important to note that if you change your settings and block certain cookies, you will not be able to take full advantage of some features of DH services, and we might not be able to provide some features you have previously chosen to receive.</p>
<p>e) Other information collected from web browsers<br>
Your web browser may also provide DH with information about your device, such as an IP address and details about the browser that you are using. Where requesting local news or weather, it may be possible for you to choose to provide DH with access to your device’s location through the web browser. We use information provided by your browser or by the link that you have clicked to understand the webpage that directed you to DH and this may be captured by performance cookies.</p>
<p>If you have any concerns about the way that we use cookies or respect your settings, then please contact us at dataprotection@dailyhive.com.</p>
<p>16. Do Not Track (DNT) browser setting<br>
DNT is a feature offered by some browsers which, when enabled, sends a signal to websites to request that your browsing is not tracked, such as by third party ad networks, social networks and analytic companies. This website does not currently respond to DNT requests.</p>
<p>17. Apps and Devices<br>
When you download or use DH apps on your mobile device, information may be accessed from or stored to your device. Most often this is used in a similar way to a web browser cookie, such as by enabling the app to ‘remember’ you or provide you with the content you have requested.</p>
<p>Your web browser or device may also provide DH with information about your device, such as a device identifier or IP address. Device identifiers may be collected automatically, such as the device ID, IP address, MAC address, IMEI number and app ID (a unique identifier relating to the particular copy of the app you are running).<br>
When you sign in to a DH app, your sign-in details may be stored securely on the device you are using, so you can access other DH apps on the same device without needing to enter your sign-in details again.</p>
<p>If you have any concerns about the information which might be accessed from or stored on your device by DH, you may wish to only access DH content through a web browser and review your web browser settings. Visit Using DH (“How can I stop my internet browser tracking my info?”) for more information.</p>
<p>18. Changes to DH’s Privacy and Cookies Policy<br>
This Privacy and Cookies Policy may be updated from time to time so you may wish to check it each time you submit personal information to DH. The date of the most recent revisions will appear on this page. If you do not agree to these changes, please do not continue to use the DH website to submit personal information to DH. If material changes are made to the Privacy and Cookies Policy, for instance affecting how we would like to use your personal information, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy Policy changes).</p>
<p>19. Other DH Operations<br>
There are no other DH Operations currently collecting data.</p>

<p>Comment Policy<br>
How do I comment on Buzz Connected Media Inc. and its subsidiaries (i.e. DailyHive.com)?<br>
To place a comment on the site all you need to do is fill in the comment form beneath the specific post to which you’d like to join the discussion. You don’t need to register or login but we ask that you include basic information like a username and email address. Including a link to your web site is optional.</p>
<p>Do I need to include my real name?<br>
No, you can comment anonymously if you like. We don’t verify whether you enter valid details in the comment form. However, if there are any concerns or complaints about your comment we may be forced to remove it if we’re not able to contact you seeking clarification.</p>
<p>Can I use different names each time I comment?<br>
Technically, yes. But we encourage you to always use the same name. We can monitor IP addresses and if we see a number of comments (particularly on the same post) coming from the same IP address but from different names this may be ground for removal if we determine a commenter is “pretending” to be a number of different people.</p>
<p>What can I do if I object to a comment on the site?<br>
Since we don’t moderate comments, we encourage anyone to contact us if they have an issue with a comment.</p>
<p>Isn’t that censorship?<br>
No. We have an open comment system because we aim to provide and promote an open channel for dialogue among readers of the site. Our intention is never to censor opinions. Commentary expressed in a civil manner will not be removed from the site.</p>
<p>Who can I contact if I have any questions, complaints or suspect comment abuse?<br>
Please contact the editorial team at feedback@dailyhive.com.</p>
<p>Community guidelines<br>
Daily Hive welcomes and encourages respectful discussion. Personal attacks, racism, misogyny, homophobia, and other forms of discrimination and harassment will be deleted without warning on all DH online platforms.&nbsp; We disavow, repudiate, and do not endorse these comments. With an average 14 million page views per month and dozens of linked public platforms, we work diligently to remove as many comments as possible that violate these guidelines as soon as they appear. We encourage users to report any abusive or discriminatory comments we may have missed or haven’t yet reviewed. It is up to all of us to do our part to promote respectful debate.
