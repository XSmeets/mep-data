The following factors typically affect the retention period:</p><ul><li><strong>Necessity for the provision of our Services</strong><br>This includes things such as executing the User Agreement with you, maintaining and improving the performance of our products, keeping our systems secure, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records. Most retention periods are determined on the basis of this general rule.<br><br></li>

<li><strong>Statutory, contractual or other similar obligations</strong><br>We may be required to retain information for certain periods of time pursuant to applicable laws or official orders (e.g. for legal compliance, tax, accounting or auditing purposes), or to detect and prevent fraudulent or illegal activity on eBay. We may also retain personal information relating to pending or future legal disputes.

We store the data for as long as necessary to comply with these obligations.<br>&nbsp;</li>

<h3>4.&nbsp; Your Privacy Rights</h3>
<p>If you are a Connecticut resident at the time we collect your personal data you may be able to assert the rights listed below, related to your personal data. We encourage you to visit our <a href="https://www.ebayinc.com/company/privacy-center/privacy-contact/" target="_blank">Privacy Center Contact Page</a> for more information on your rights and our practices.

If we deny your request, we will explain the reasons in our response.</p>
<p>For eBay to fulfill your request, you must provide sufficient information for us to reasonably verify that you are the consumer from whom we collected the personal data. The information you send for us to verify your identity will be used for this purpose only. If we are unable to verify your identity or if we suspect fraudulent activity, we may decline to comply with your request.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Right to Access.</strong> You may have the right to confirm with us whether we are processing your personal data. You may also request access to such personal data.</li>

Please note that you may still receive generalized ads after opting out of targeted advertising and your eBay experience may still be personalized based on your eBay activity.</li>
<li><strong>Right to Opt out of Profiling.</strong> Connecticut users have the right to opt-out of “profiling,” which CTPA defines as solely automated processing of personal data to make certain decisions with a legal or similarly-significant effect on you (such as credit decisions, and access to basic goods and services). eBay does not engage in profiling as described above.</li>
